Marsh, playing left, was jogging forward. Sosa, playing third base, was backpedaling. They both were going for the Jazz Chisholm Jr. pop-up in shallow left field.\\nMarsh's right elbow appeared to drill Sosa in the back as Sosa made the putout. Sosa held onto the ball long enough to secure the catch before dropping it to the ground, rolling over and grabbing at his back.\\nMarsh, on the other hand, came out of the collision OK. Sosa was down for a couple minutes while receiving attention from trainers. He eventually walked off the field and received a hug from a remorseful Marsh. Sosa patted Marsh on the back of the head.\\nSosa officially left the game with a back contusion, but he told reporters postgame that he's feeling better and is good to go for Sunday's series finale.\\nEdmundo Sosa left the game after colliding with Brandon Marsh while catching a pop fly pic.twitter.com/uzey9Lwigs\\nSosa's scare was hardly the injury headliner, though. Yankees superstar right fielder Aaron Judge missed the game with what was ultimately diagnosed as a flexor strain in his right elbow . Fortunately for Judge, the two-time AL MVP isn't dealing with a UCL tear and is expected to have a short stay on the IL.\\nThe Phillies were without their starting right fielder, too. Nick Castellanos sat out with a left knee injury that he suffered Friday while running toward the right field wall to make the final out of a 12-5, series-opening win over the Yankees. Castellanos' injury doesn't appear to be serious, as Phillies manager Rob Thompson said before the game that they'll check back on the veteran's knee for Sunday.\\nBefore Sosa exited, he deposited a two-run home run in the top of the seventh inning. The versatile 29-year-old launched a 424-foot no-doubter to center field. The night before, he helped the Phillies polish off another decisive win over the Yankees with an RBI single that ignited a four-run ninth inning.\\nEdmundo Sosa mashes this ball to put the @Phillies up big in the 7th \ud83d\ude24 pic.twitter.com/IaLxXnaNRe\\nSosa's homer Saturday was the Phillies' second big fly of the afternoon. Bryce Harper blasted a 425-foot solo shot in the third inning. Harper's smack to right center was part of Philadelphia's climb to a 4-0 lead through four frames. Then the Phillies distanced themselves in the seventh.\\nFollowing Sosa's dinger, New York committed its 10th error in the past five games, this one resulting from a Chisholm bobble on a potential inning-ending, double-play grounder. Then surging slugger Kyle Schwarber drove home two runs with a double to center field. Schwarber now has five extra-base hits \u2014 including four home runs \u2014 and 10 RBI in his last four games.\\n\\nThe Yankees faced a 9-1 deficit, having allowed at least seven runs for the fifth time in their eight games since the All-Star break. They scattered three runs of their own in the seventh and eighth innings, two from a Giancarlo Stanton long ball, but a massive comeback wasn't in the cards.\\nPhillies starter Ranger Su\u00e1rez improved to 8-4 after allowing just one run in 5 2/3 innings while striking out eight batters while issuing only one walk and throwing a season-high 108 pitches.\\nBut the bats were the star of the show for the Phillies, who have recorded double-digit hits three games in a row. Luckily for Sosa, the one he took to his back doesn't appear as consequential as his two-run homer in the seventh.\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 21:56:24 +0000\\n        Source: Yahoo Sports\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Yankees captain Aaron Judge to go on injured list with flexor strain but no damage to UCL in elbow\\n        Description: New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge will go on the injured list with a flexor strain in his right elbow, but a scan showed no damage to the ulnar collateral ligament of the two-time AL MVP.\\n        Link: https://www.nbcsports.com/mlb/news/yankees-captain-aaron-judge-to-go-on-injured-list-with-flexor-strain-but-no-damage-to-ucl-in-elbow\\n        Content: NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Yankees captain Aaron Judge will go on the injured list with a flexor strain in his right elbow, but a scan showed no damage to the ulnar collateral ligament of the two-time AL MVP.\\nManager Aaron Boone said Judge will have 10 days to two weeks of no throwing and will be the designated hitter at first when he returns.

The good news is that the UCL is intact, meaning there is no tear in the ligament.\\n\\\"Overall, we got some good news. It is going to require an IL stint with the thought it\u2019s right about that 10 days and those few days coming off, probably in DH mode and then starting throwing in around then,\\\" Boone explained after Saturday's game. \\\"And then hopefully, get back to the outfield shortly thereafter\u2026as long as the symptoms are what they need to be.\\\"\\nJudge has already taken a PRP injection and will sit for a few days and then start swinging the bat again and see where they are at when they get to the 10-day mark. Boone is optimistic Judge could return in the minimum 10 days.\\nThe Yankees skipper has already spoken with Giancarlo Stanton on potentially getting work in the outfield to see if he's an option when Judge returns. This week is when they'll start working that into Stanton's routine, but there's nothing imminent.\\nJudge was missing from Saturday's lineup and Boone said that the Yankees Captain had felt something in his elbow on a throw during the previous series against the Blue Jays in Toronto. After starting as DH on Wednesday and the off day on Thursday, New York felt as though Judge was fine, but the injury popped up again in Friday's loss.\\n\\\"Just last night (he) was really dealing with it,\\\" Boone said prior to Saturday's game. \\\"He couldn\u2019t really throw well from the outfield.\\\"\\nJudge spoke to the media after the results came in and said that he felt something off in his elbow on a throw home, a play prior to the one he winced on. He's never had an elbow injury before and even tried to convince the team to let him avoid an IL stint so he can still bat. But the organization advised against it. Boone said that they didn't want to risk Judge injuring himself further by hitting and wanted to take care of the strain immediately.\\n\\\"Throwing is the main concern. Hitting, it happens too quick and it\u2019s not the motion where I haven\u2019t felt anything,\\\" Judge explained. \\\"The muscle that\u2019s hurt is the muscle that\u2019s used to grip. There might be some issue with that, but I\u2019ve been hitting with it the last couple of days. If I can hit, I can be out there.\\\"\\nAs for who will take Judge's spot on the roster, the Yankees have a few outfield options in Triple-A. Everson Pereira and Bryan De La Cruz are likely options as they are both right-handed, and then there's prospect Spencer Jones , who has been tearing the cover off the ball with Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. However, Jones missed Friday's game with back spasms.\\nDespite that, it's unlikely the Yankees will call up Jones, as he's not on the 40-man roster and this would be a temporary stint that won't come with enough at-bats to justify the move.\\nJudge was asked about whether the team can withstand his absence and the AL MVP front-runner said he believes in his teammates.\\n\\\"Guys are going to step up, that\u2019s what it comes down to,\\\" Judge said. \\\"I always go back to that 2019 team where I felt everyone got banged up and everyone stepped up and played bigger roles than what they signed up for coming into the season. I expect the same for guys\u2026 especially now in the second half, going to the end of the stretch.

Despite nine hits and five walks, the Yanks scored just four runs. They went 1-for-10 with RISP and left 11 men on base.\\n-Meanwhile, Marcus Stroman put his team behind the eight ball early, allowing a run in the first inning to put New York in an early hole. The right-hander did not have a successful outing and only managed to go 3.2 innings.\\nIt was in that fourth inning when things really spiraled for Stroman. Down 2-0 at that point, Stroman walked the leadoff hitter -- one of four walks in the inning -- before a single and another walk loaded the bases. The third walk of the inning forced in a run and Trea Turner 's force out brought home another. After a wild pitch and another walk loaded the bases once again, Stroman's day was done.\\nYerry De los Santos came in and threw one pitch and got Bryce Harper to ground out to end the inning and save Stroman from further disaster. In all, Stroman allowed four runs on five hits and four walks while striking out four on 89 pitches (50 strikes). He also allowed a home run to Harper in the third and his ERA rose to 6.09 through eight starts.\\n-The Yankees got a run back in the bottom of the fourth thanks to Jasson Dominguez 's RBI single, but with runners on the corners and two outs, Trent Grisham grounded out to end the threat.\\n-After scoring a run in the sixth, which was charged to De los Santos, Philadelphia went into the seventh inning up 5-1, where Allan Winans took the ball. In just his third appearance of the season and first since June 28, Winans wore it on the chin. He allowed four runs (three earned) in the seventh after Edmundo Sosa blasted a two-run shot and Kyle Schwarber hit a two-run double.\\nWinans went back out for the eighth and managed to strand a runner on second base (leadoff double) with two strikeouts and a groundout before pitching a clean ninth inning.\\n- Giancarlo Stanton 's two-run homer in the seventh cut the deficit to 9-3.

The team is currently awaiting imaging results.\\nAnd while it doesn't appear to be as potentially serious, Nick Castellanos will sit out Saturday's game due to a knee injury suffered in Friday's 12-5 win over the Yankees. Castellanos jammed his left knee while running toward the right field wall to make the final out, according to Phillies manager Rob Thomson .\\n\\nThe Phillies' right fielder went 2-for-5 in the Phillies' win and is hitting .270/.311/.434 with 23 doubles, 13 home runs and 56 RBI. He's third among Philadelphia's regulars in homers and second in RBI.\\nCastellanos' knee was sore Saturday, so the Phillies decided to keep him out of the lineup. Thomson said they will check back on the knee for Sunday, but it appears this is more of a day-to-day issue compared to what the Yankees are fearing with Judge, pending his MRI results.\\nWith Castellanos out, Max Kepler (.201, .661 OPS, 11 HR) will get the start in right field. Brandon Marsh (.244, .659 OPS) will move over to left field and Johan Rojas (.232, .589) will play center on Saturday. That lack of punch without Castellanos might be a factor in what the Phillies pursue before next week's MLB trade deadline.\\n\\nAnother outfielder could help and Philadelphia has reportedly shown interest in the Cleveland Guardians' Steven Kwan (.282, .762 OPS).

This is following the 22-year-old Kurtz being named the AL Player of the Week.\\nThe betting market has taken notice as well.\\nKurtz opened up far down the odds board to win American League Rookie of the Year at BetMGM with 80-1 odds. New York Yankees outfielder Jasson Dominguez opened as the favorite at +600. It wasn't all smooth sailing for Kurtz, as Yahoo's Jordan Shusterman detailed in this article , as he went through and 0-for-21 skid in May before breaking out and becoming the best hitter in baseball in July.\\n\\nOn June 14, Kurtz was down to 14-1 odds (tied for the second-best), but still a massive underdog to his Athletics teammate Jacob Wilson, who was -1000 to win the AL ROY. That equates to roughly a 90.9% chance to win the award.\\nEven five days ago on July 21, Wilson was the +100 favorite at BetMGM and Kurtz was second at +160. Wilson had second-most wagers (11%, behind the Royals' Jac Caglionone) and by far the most money of any player at 33%. Wilson also represented the sportsbook's biggest liability on the award.\\nBut after Friday night's offensive explosion, Kurtz became the odds-on favorite for the first time all season and now has -2000 odds to win, an implied probability of 95% to win the award.\\nIt's an astonishing baseball \u2014 and betting \u2014 story, and one we'll be sure to follow throughout the rest of the season.\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 15:59:00 +0000\\n        Source: Yahoo Sports\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Aaron Judge out of Yankees' lineup Saturday due to 'elbow issue'\\n        Description: Manager Aaron Boone said Judge was having trouble throwing the ball from the outfield Friday.\\n        Link: https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/breaking-news/article/aaron-judge-out-of-yankees-lineup-saturday-due-to-elbow-issue-150849711.html\\n        Content: Aaron Judge is not in the New York Yankees' lineup Saturday against the Philadelphia Phillies due to an \\\"elbow issue,\\\" manager Aaron Boone said.\\n\\\"He felt like he was fine on the off day [Thursday],\\\" Boone said. \\\"Last night he was really dealing with it, couldn't really throw from the outfield.\\\"\\nAccording to Boone, Judge was taken for imaging, and the team is currently awaiting the results.\\n[ Join or create a Yahoo Fantasy Football league for the 2025 NFL season ]\\nJudge was seen wincing and gripping his right hand after a throw during Tuesday night's win over the Toronto Blue Jays.

When Yankees outfielder Trent Grisham lined out to right field to end the game, Nick Castellanos wound up hitting the outfield wall in a bit of an awkward way. It cost him a start Saturday afternoon and may or may not keep him out a bit longer.\\n\u201cThe last play last night, where he went back towards the wall, he just kind of jammed his left knee,\u201d manager Rob Thomson said. \u201cHe came in a little bit sore today, so keeping him out. We\u2019ll see how it is tomorrow.\u201d Asked if it was a day-to-day thing, Thomson said it was.\\nWhile he never wants to have to deal with injuries, without Castellanos it did give him a chance to tinker a bit with the lineup.\\nI don\u2019t mind (tinkering), really,\u201d he said. \u201cIt gets (Johan) Rojas a chance to get in there and (Edmundo) Sosa\u2019s back in there today so it gives these guys a little bit of an opportunity to get some at-bats and get some reps.\u201d\\nAlso on the injury front, the Yankees held out star outfield Aaron Judge due to a sore elbow. The New York Post reported that Judge was to undergo an MRI before Saturday\u2019s game as well as see a team doctor. Judge leads the league with a .342 average and is tops in RBI with 85. His 129 hits are also a league best.\\nWalker, Nola updates\\nWhen asked if Taijuan Walker will stay in the rotation, Thomson didn\u2019t hesitate with his answer. \u201cYeah. Yeah, he\u2019s got it. I think the next start is the last one in Chicago.\u201d Thomson was referring to Wednesday afternoon\u2019s game against the White Sox. Walker admitted after his start on Friday that he knows and accepts the fact that he\u2019ll be heading back to the bullpen in the near future as Aaron Nola gets closer to being put back into the starting rotation. Nola had a bullpen session on Friday and now will start to see some live action.\\n\u201cHe will go out on a rehab assignment Thursday, (with Lehigh Valley)\u201d Thomson said. \u201cYeah will keep him the same (60 pitches). Three up-downs.\u201d Mick Abel struggled through five innings with the Iron Pigs Friday, allowing seven hits and five earned runs while walking three. But the manager wasn\u2019t too displeased with the results.\\n\u201cCommand was off a little bit,\u201d Thomson said. \u201cIn the notes the good thing is they mentioned he maintained his focus, maintained his poise even though he didn\u2019t have his command and tried to fight through it. So that\u2019s a good sign. He\u2019s really grown up so it was good to see him do that last night, have some failure and just keep fighting through it.\u201d\\nBohm to rejoin on road trip\\nThird baseman Alec Bohm will join the team Sunday in New York then will fly with them to Chicago for the series against the White Sox. \u201cStill a little bit sore. Just check him out tomorrow and see how he is.\u201d Bohm was hit by a pitch from Yu Darvish back on July 12 and it was later determined he had a fractured rib. In his place, Thomson has been rotating Otto Kemp and Edmundo Sosa at third, but hinted he may have both of them in the lineup on Sunday.\\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see both of them, really. Kind of flip them back and forth and maybe get Kemp back to the outfield at some point. I\u2019m sure tomorrow we\u2019ll have Kemp at third and Sosa at second and probably Wes Wilson in the outfield.\u201d\\nThe Phillies are scheduled to face Yankees left-hander Carlos Rodon on Sunday.\\n\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 13:51:42 +0000\\n        Source: NBC Sports Philadelphia\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Shaikin: Home again? Why Kenley Jansen could be a good trade match for Dodgers\\n        Description: An MLB trade deadline reunion between the Dodgers and Kenley Jansen could make sense for a team looking to bolster its right-handed pitching out of the bullpen.\\n        Link: https://sports.yahoo.com/article/shaikin-home-again-why-kenley-113000880.html\\n        Content: Kenley Jansen signed his first professional contract with the Dodgers 21 years ago. He was Clayton Kershaw \u2019s catcher in rookie ball. He has been honored as an All-Star four times. He has saved more games than all but three men in major league history, all of them Hall of Famers. He won a World Series with the Dodgers .\\nFor all that Jansen has accomplished in his two decades in pro ball, there is one thing he has not experienced: He never has been traded.\\nThat could happen in the coming days, with baseball\u2019s trade deadline next Thursday. As we talked about that possibility Friday at Angel Stadium, and about how the sport can be a cold business at times, he dropped 11 words that stood out.\\n\u201cI thought,\u201d he said, \u201cI would play my whole career with the Dodgers.\u201d\\nMaybe you can go home again.\\nRead more: With trade deadline looming, Dodgers showcase revived offense in win over Boston\\nThe Dodgers are urgently shopping for right-handed relievers. In Anaheim, Jansen is enjoying a season that by some measures is his best since 2021, his last season with the Dodgers .\\nFirst things first: Jansen did not sign with the Angels just to rack up saves. He is 36 saves shy of 500, a milestone reached only by Mariano Rivera and Trevor Hoffman.\\n\u201cI came here with one goal in mind,\u201d Jansen said, \u201cand the goal was to help this team turn around, to end that playoff drought. That\u2019s what I\u2019m here for.\\n\u201cIf they move me, I\u2019d definitely feel disappointed we didn\u2019t accomplish it.\u201d\\nBut let\u2019s be real: The longest playoff drought in the majors is likely to hit 11 years. The Angels are 4\u00bd games out of a postseason berth, but they would have to pass six teams to sneak into the last wild-card spot in the American League playoffs. Baseball Prospectus projects their chance of making the playoffs at 2%.\\nThe Angels demoted their fifth starter this month. They have been running bullpen games because they had no one in their farm system ready to fill the vacancy. They only have two starters you could pencil into their 2026 rotation.\\nThey need pitching depth, and it would be organizational malpractice not to get some by trading their pending free agents, Jansen included.\\nFor the Angels, the optimal outcome would be a team desperate for a closer overpaying to get Jansen.\\nHowever, such a team would be more likely to overpay for the marquee names on the market, including Jhoan Duran of the Minnesota Twins, Emmanuel Clase of the Cleveland Guardians and Felix Bautista of the Baltimore Orioles, with a second tier led by David Bednar of the Pittsburgh Pirates and Ryan Helsley of the St. Louis Cardinals.\\nThe Dodgers hate to overpay.\\nJansen has 17 saves and one blown save, with a 1.00 earned-run average in save situations and a 3.19 ERA overall. The latter is his lowest ERA since 2021. By ERA+, a statistic that accounts for league and ballpark factors, Jansen is at 133 \u2014 or 33% better than league average.\\nThe only Dodgers relievers with an ERA+ above 133: left-handers Alex Vesia and Jack Dreyer .\\nDodgers relievers have thrown 49.1% of the team\u2019s innings pitched; the highest percentage of any major league team. Vesia, Anthony Banda and the injured Tanner Scott rank among the top 20 in appearances. Ben Casparius , who earned his first major league save Friday , ranked second among major league relievers in innings pitched.\\nIn an ideal world, the Dodgers would enter the playoffs with four primary right-handed relievers: Blake Treinen , Michael Kopech , Brusdar Graterol and Evan Phillips .\\nPhillips is out for the season. Treinen could return from the injured list next week, with Kopech possibly to follow next month and Graterol in September, but it is risky to count on injured players to return healthy and effective.\\nIn a major league career that started in 2010, Jansen never has been on the injured list because of an elbow or forearm issue, and his two stints for shoulder inflammation were brief.\\nThe Dodgers could drop Jansen into their mix of high-leverage right-handers. They would not want Jansen if he would want to be the unquestioned closer.\\nHe is getting the job done as a closer, and he is getting closer to 500 saves. But the Dodgers' analysts would probably take note of his career highs in exit velocity and hard-hit balls, and a .774 OPS against left-handers that compares unfavorably to his .600 career mark, and might want to spot him against a run of right-handers. Could be the sixth inning, could be the ninth.\\nRead more: Beyond the bullpen, how aggressive will the Dodgers be at the MLB trade deadline?\\nWhether it\u2019s the Dodgers or any other contending team, would Jansen consider a role outside the ninth inning?\\n\u201cAt that point, it\u2019s just about getting rings,\u201d Jansen said. \u201cMy goal is to win. You play for that, always. I understand there is a milestone I am close to. But, at the end of the day, it\u2019s what you play for. You play to win. You play to win a World Series.\\n\u201cIf I have to go throw the sixth, seventh, eighth, I would do it. I\u2019m a professional. I would do what I do best, and that is pitch.\u201d\\nJansen said he hasn\u2019t given up on this Angels team, or this Angels season. He would love to win in Anaheim. The Angels could help him do that: Trade him for another pitching piece that could help them next year, then sign Jansen again over the winter.\\nSign up for more Dodgers news with Dodgers Dugout.

They're just really good at all aspects of the game.\\\"\\nAnd in the off-season their roster got even better. After their starting pitcher rotation was hit by injuries last year, they brought in Blake Snell and Roki Sasaki to add greater strength in depth.\\nThey also re-signed veteran pitcher Clayton Kershaw and knew that at some point Shohei Ohtani would be able to pitch again after recovering from elbow surgery.\\nOhtani is a 'unicorn' in that he is a two-way player. The Japanese star is the first MLB player to be elite at both pitching and hitting at the same time.\\nAfter joining the Dodgers in a deal worth $700m (\u00a3558m), he could only hit in his first season, yet still earned his third Most Valuable Player award as they won the World Series.\\nThe Dodgers' offensive line-up also features two former MVPs in Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman, who are part of a nucleus of players on long-term contracts.\\nAnd the team bolstered that core with Tommy Edman and Teoscar Hernandez signing extensions.\\nIt's a good job the Dodgers secured that pitching insurance for this season because their injury woes returned, with four of their starting pitchers having had spells out.\\nThat has meant they could not sustain that early-season form and have had to use their relieving pitchers - known as the bullpen - far more than any other MLB team.\\nThat has taken its toll, with six relieving pitchers currently out injured, and the team generally struggling for form - in the outfield, on the mound and at the plate.\\nBetts has hit three home runs in his past 49 games and Freeman one in 61.\\nAt the start of this month, the Dodgers lost seven games in a row for the first time since September 2017. And since that 8-0 start to the season, their record is 53-43.\\nManager Dave Roberts said on Tuesday: \\\"It better be rock bottom, as far as how we've been pitching, how we've been playing defence.\\n\\\"I think the offence is kind of starting to tick up, which is good. There's certainly more in there. But I think as far as quality of baseball, it's been a tough watch. It really has.\\\"\\nOhtani's class continues to shine through though. Only Seattle's Cal Raleigh (39) has hit more home runs than Ohtani (37) this season.\\nOhtani homered in five consecutive games over the past week, and in one of those games he also had three strikeouts as a pitcher.\\nThe 31-year-old's return to the mound last month has provided the Dodgers with some relief.\\nSo far he has made six starts, with his innings gradually being increased, and in his third game back, Ohtani threw his fastest MLB pitch ever (101.7mph).\\nOhtani is not scheduled to pitch again until Wednesday, with Dustin May set to be the Dodgers' starting pitcher for Sunday's game against Boston.\\nAnd there will be a familiar face on the Fenway Park mound.\\nWalker Buehler left the Dodgers for the Red Sox in the off-season and before the start of their three-game series on Friday, some of his former team-mates presented Buehler with his World Series ring for last season's championship triumph.\\nThe Dodgers won Friday's game 5-2 to improve their record to 61-43 atop the National League West division.\\nBoston are 55-50 and sit third in the American League East, with Wilyer Abreu (20 home runs) their leading hitter.\\nAfter going into the All-Star break on a 10-game winning streak, the Red Sox have won just two of their seven games since.\\nAs it stands, they would end their three-year play-off absence, but they too need an upturn in form to be sure of securing a wild-card spot.\\nBBC Sport will be showing an MLB game live every Sunday evening until the end of the regular season on 28 September.\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 08:43:03 +0000\\n        Source: BBC\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Mets' Francisco Lindor says swing is in a 'good spot' after collecting three hits in win over Giants\\n        Description: Mets shortstop Francisco Lindor continued where he left off with a three-hit performance against the Giants on Friday night and said his swing is feeling right.\\n        Link: https://sny.tv/articles/mets-francisco-lindor-swing-offense-better-giants\\n        Content: It wasn't long ago when Francisco Lindor was in the worst funk of his career, but the Mets shortstop has turned things around at the right time.\\nAfter breaking his career-worst 0-for-31 skid in the team's series finale against the Angels on Wednesday, Lindor picked up where he left off in Friday's impressive 8-1 win over the Giants .\\nLindor went 3-for-5, but as skipper Carlos Mendoza put it after the game, it's how his at-bats look that is encouraging to him.\\n\\\"His ability to use the whole field, and going the other way, that\u2019s when he\u2019s at his best,\\\" Mendoza said. \\\"Some really good signs and it\u2019s good to have him feeling that way.\\\"\\nMendoza broke down Lindor's three hits and said there was something to like about each of them. His first hit was a single up the middle in the first inning. The second was when he pulled an inside fastball over the right field wall for his 20th home run of the season. And even though he struck out the next two times, his final at-bat in the ninth saw Lindor go the other way for a ground-rule double down the left field line.\\n\\\"I got rhythm. I feel good,\\\" Lindor said of his swing of late. \\\"I did what I wanted to do today. Had a game plan and was able to execute it. That means my swing is in a good spot. Stay the course, continue to be better every day.\\\"\\nIt's been a rough few months for Lindor, who was hitting .283 entering June and was looking every bit of the MVP-caliber player that helped the Mets get into the postseason last year. At the lowest point of his skid in July, Lindor was hitting only .245. But after his five hits in two games, he's looking like himself at the plate again.\\nLindor credits the team, and especially the hitting staff, for keeping him positive and getting him back to a good spot with his swing.\\n\\\"It was coming and going. I work, feel good, then it disappears,\\\" Lindor said of why his swing went awry. \\\"It\u2019s human nature when you go through tough times \u2026 you rely on the people around you and hope to get a hit or two.\\\"\\nLindor closed his answer with his signature smile. And there's a lot to smile about with the Mets right now. Friday's victory pushed their winning streak to five games and they are clinging to first place in the NL East over the Phillies. But if the Mets hope to win their first division title since 2015, they'll need Lindor and his swing to feel good to get there.\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 05:53:33 +0000\\n        Source: SNY\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Mets start West Coast trip with impressive, wire-to-wire win over Giants, 8-1\\n        Description: The Mets started their West Coast trip with an impressive 8-1 wire-to-wire win over the Giants in San Francisco on Friday night.\\n        Link: https://sny.tv/articles/mets-giants-takeaways-7-25-25\\n        Content: The Mets started their West Coast trip with an impressive 8-1 wire-to-wire win over the Giants in San Francisco on Friday night.\\nNew York (60-44) remains 0.5 games ahead of the Phillies, who won their game earlier in the evening , to stay atop the NL East.\\n-Against a Cy Young-caliber pitcher in Logan Webb , the Mets jumped on him early in the first. Brandon Nimmo lined a double just over the head of left fielder Heliot Ramos -- who took a bad route to the ball -- and Francisco Lindor followed with a single. Lindor stole second before Juan Soto rolled over a grounder to the right side to plate Nimmo and move Lindor to third. Pete Alonso drove in Lindor with a sac fly to give the Mets an early 2-0 lead.\\nClay Holmes wasn't much better in his half of the first, allowing a single to Ramos and a double to Rafael Devers to lead off. Willy Adames grounded out to drive in the Giants' first run. After a walk to Matt Chapman, H olmes bounced back by getting Mike Yastryzmski to fly out and Wilmer Flores to ground out to end the 33-pitch opening frame.\\n-Webb's struggles continued in the fourth as Brett Baty and Francisco Alvarez led off with back-to-back singles. Ronny Mauricio walked to load the bases for Tyrone Taylor with no outs. Taylor chopped a grounder up the middle but Adames made a nice scoop and flip to second base, but Taylor beat out the potential double play as Baty scored. After Taylor stole second, Nimmo hit an opposite-field single to drive in two and push the Mets' lead to 6-1.\\nWebb would not last beyond the fourth, pitching his shortest outing of the season.\\n-Holmes did not last much longer as he struggled in the fifth. The right-hander allowed back-to-back singles to the No. 8 and 9 hitters, but Holmes got Ramos to pop up and Devers to strike out. He then got Adames to pop up to get through the fifth.\\nHolmes tied a career-high with 104 pitches (64 strikes) through his five innings. He allowed just one run on six hits, one walk while striking out two batters.\\n-The Mets' lineup wouldn't get much going against the Giants' bullpen, but it didn't matter as New York's bullpen was just as sharp with the team using three arms to get the final 12 outs of the game.\\n-Alonso went 0-for-4 with a sac fly RBI in this one, but he helped the Mets on the defensive end, saving Holmes, Lindor and Mauricio from errors with his glove.\\nLindor was struggling mightily before the series finale against the Angels, and his hot bat has traveled to the West Coast. After his single in the first inning, the Mets shortstop got around on an inside pitch from Webb and deposited it over the wall in right field for his 20th homer of the season. Lindor's last at-bat saw him drive a ground-rule double down the left field line. He finished 3-for-5.\\nThe Mets scored their final two runs in the ninth after Luisangel Acuna scored from third on a wild pitch and Soto's single drove in Lindor from third.\\n-The Mets were 3-for-3 (Nimmo, Taylor, Lindor) on stolen base attempts against Webb.

He\u2019s just the second player in Major League Baseball history to have four homers in a six-hit game, joining Shawn Green of the Los Angeles Dodgers on May 23, 2002 at Milwaukee, and he matched Green\u2019s MLB record with 19 total bases.\\nIt was the first six-hit game for the Athletics since Joe DeMaestri on July 8, 1955 at Detroit.\\nThe 23-year-old also had a single and a double that hit just below the yellow line over the visitor\u2019s bullpen in the fourth inning.\\nKurtz singled in the first and his two-run homer in the second put the Athletics ahead 5-0. His solo shot in the sixth made it 10-2. His third homer was his longest, a 414-foot drive into the second deck in the eighth.\\nKurtz\u2019s final homer came against outfielder Cooper Hummel, a three-run, opposite-field line drive to the Crawford boxes in left field that made it 15-2.\\nKurtz extended his hitting streak to 12 games and his 23 home runs are the most for an A\u2019s rookie since Yoenis C\u00e9spedes in 2012 and fourth most in franchise history.\\nTyler Soderstrom and Shea Langeliers also homered for the A\u2019s, who had a season high in runs.\\nJeffrey Springs (9-7) allowed two runs over six innings.

Here are all four homers and the rest of his 6-for-6 night, featuring an increasingly jubilant A's broadcast:\\nSomehow, that wasn't the end of the 22-year-old Kurtz's accomplishments, as he tied Shawn Green for the most total bases in a single game with 19.\\nHe also tied Green (and others) for modern era records with six runs scored and five extra base hits. He posted eight RBI, one more than Green's legendary game in 2002. It's not hyperbolic to call it the best offensive game in the history of baseball, all accomplished by a player who was in college at the start of the 2024 season.\\nThe punchline to all this was Kurtz's double in the fourth inning. Had it traveled perhaps two feet farther, we would be talking about the first five-homer game baseball has ever seen.\\nWe're on Nick Kurtz Cycle Watch after this RBI double \ud83d\udc40 pic.twitter.com/sPjRfqEmSU\\nKurtz did all that against the first-place Astros, with each homer off a different pitcher. They weren't exactly the staff aces, though, with starting pitcher Ryan Gusto (4.46 ERA entering Friday), relievers Nick Hernandez (9.00 in one inning), Kaleb Ort (5.40) and Cooper Hummel (position player) all feeling the damage.\\nIt was the second four-homer game of the season, following Arizona Diamondbacks third baseman Eugenio Suarez's big night on April 26 .\\nSince RBI became official in 1920, only one MLB player has had, over the course of his entire career (same game or not), a game with 4+ HR a game with 5+ XBH a game with 6+ hits a game with 6+ runs a game with 8+ RBI That one player is Nick Kurtz. He did it all tonight. pic.twitter.com/Uob1twG5uw\\nThat performance adds to what was already a breakout campaign for Kurtz, who entered Friday as the AL Rookie of the Year favorite at BetMGM and most certainly exited it that way. He has been the best hitter in baseball \u2014 not rookie, just hitter \u2014 over the past nine weeks or so and is now about to send some memorabilia to the Hall of Fame.\\n\\nIt has been only 368 days since Kurtz signed his first contract with the A's, joining the club after back-to-back All-American seasons at Wake Forest. He proceeded to dominate the minor leagues much like he did in the ACC, posting a 1.283 OPS between Single-A and Double-A in 2024, then a 1.040 OPS in Triple-A before his call-up in late April.\\nKurtz actually got off to a slow start in his major league career, slashing .208/.259/.299 with only one homer through May 19, the last day of an 0-for-21 skid. Since then, well, he's slashed .352/.427/.870 with 24 homers in 43 games. That's a 90.4-homer pace when extrapolated over 162 games.\\nYou have to go back to Joe DiMaggio to find a player with this many extra-base hits in his first 66 MLB games . He has one more than Ted Williams.\\n\\nHitters who enter the majors and dominate this much over even just half a season are breathtakingly rare. Kurtz was always seen as one of the best hitters in his draft class, with concerns about injuries and his defensive utility as a first-base only player dragging down his stock, but this is well beyond even the wildest expectations for him.\\nSince breaking that slump in May, he has been better at the plate than Aaron Judge, Shohei Ohtani, Cal Raleigh and every other MLB player you could possibly think of. It's unlikely he will continue this pace, but there are good players \u2014 great ones, even \u2014 who go their entire careers without a stretch like this.\\nSo all of that adds up to a win for the A's. They drafted a guy fourth overall and one year later have a budding superstar. Good work.\\nThe A's have become baseball's punchline over the past few years. Some teams have been worse on the field, such as the Chicago White Sox and Colorado Rockies, but those teams are at least playing at major league stadiums. The A's are a team that hasn't touched 70 wins since 2021, currently playing at a Triple-A ballpark in Sacramento, while waiting for a dubiously funded stadium in Las Vegas.\\nNone of that screams \\\"well-run team,\\\" but the interesting thing about the A's is they now have a very fun collection of young players, who could theoretically be a draw once the team reaches Nevada to open its doors.\\n\\nKurtz is the new big name, but there's also late-blooming All-Star designated hitter Brent Rooker in the middle of the lineup. Kurtz is the Rookie of the Year favorite, but he has company on the leaderboard with Jacob Wilson, the No. 6 pick of the 2023 MLB Draft who is currently hitting .312, and Denzel Clarke, a standout defender who also hit the third-longest homer in MLB this season.\\nAnd then there are guys like outfielders Tyler Soderstrom and Lawrence Butler, who have flashed promise in their first few MLB seasons.\\nPitching hasn't been a similar success for the A's, but every team would rather have a group of promising young hitters with oodles of team control than pitchers. The franchise is still a long ways away from contending for a World Series, but it is miles closer than it was last year.\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 02:58:06 +0000\\n        Source: Yahoo Sports\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Mets pitching prospect Brandon Sproat's scoreless streak ends in gutsy win for Triple-A Syracuse\\n        Description: The latest on Brandon Sproat, a top pitching prospect for the New York Mets.\\n        Link: https://sny.tv/articles/mets-brandon-sproat-scoreless-streak-ends-gutsy\\n        Content: Brandon Sproat scattered two runs on five hits while striking out three and walking two in five innings of Friday's 8-2 Triple-A Syracuse Mets win over the Kansas City Royals-affiliated Omaha Storm Chasers.\\nNew York's top pitching and overall prospect , according to SNY's Joe DeMayo , had not allowed an earned run in more than a month.\\nThe scoreless streak snapped in the top of the third inning when Michael Massey 's ground-rule double on a fly ball to center field scored Jordan Groshans and Rudy Martin .\\nSproat's stretch without an earned run spanned 25 innings, starting June 22.

Ever since, the veteran had looked glaringly off, batting below .200 over 48 games.\\nAt the end of this past week\u2019s homestand on Wednesday, however, Hern\u00e1ndez recorded his first three-hit game since April. And on Friday, he kept the momentum going, drawing a run-scoring walk with the bases loaded in the third inning before belting a two-run insurance homer in the top of the eighth.\\n\u201cObviously, a huge at-bat,\u201d manager Dave Roberts said of Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s home run, just his second in the last 27 games.\\nAndy Pages played a key role Friday, as well, continuing his own upward trajectory after a trying couple of weeks.\\nFrom June 26 to July 19, Pages saw what was once a near-.300 batting average tumble, hitting .206 over an 18-game stretch. The slide helped keep him from reaching the All-Star Game, then continued for the first two games coming out of the break \u2014 making him one of many Dodgers hitters mired in a midseason slump.\\nBut in the last four games of the team\u2019s recent homestand, Pages had two home runs and two multihit games.\\nOn Friday, Pages' recent surge continued, including a double that set up Tommy Edman (another recently slumping hitter) for the opening run in the second inning, a sacrifice fly after Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s walk in the third, and a single again after Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s big fly in the eighth.\\n\u201cI think they\u2019re just taking better at-bats,\u201d Roberts said of Hern\u00e1ndez and Pages. \u201cHaving those two guys in the middle of the order doing what they\u2019re doing makes life easier for all of us.\u201d\\nThere were other bright spots in the Dodgers\u2019 win. Will Smith went two for five to raise his National League-leading batting average to .325. Freddie Freeman had a pair of singles, recording consecutive multihit games for only the second time since early June. And while Shohei Ohtani saw his home run streak snapped at five games, he still reached base twice.\\nRead more: Beyond the bullpen, how aggressive will the Dodgers be at the MLB trade deadline?\\nTwo hitters who could be more important to the Dodgers\u2019 deadline calculus struggled, with Michael Conforto going only one for four (albeit with a sixth-inning double) and Hyeseong Kim extending his recent slump with a golden sombrero (four strikeouts).\\nBut on the whole, the offense (which combined for 10 hits, the third time that has happened in the last 10 games) did enough \u2014 backing up a five-inning, two-run start from Emmet Sheehan (a Connecticut native who attended nearby Boston College) and the first scoreless effort from the Dodgers\u2019 beleaguered bullpen since July 3, including a first career save for Ben Casparius (another Connecticut native who grew up playing high school tournaments at Fenway Park).\\n\u201cIt was pretty cool, especially to do it behind Emmet,\u201d Casparius said. \u201cWe kind of talked about that, hopefully getting into the same game.

The Mets' outfield was a subject brought up to Stearns since the centerfield platoon of Tyrone Taylor and Jeff McNeil has, while playing admirably, not produced consistently enough.\\nThere have been rumblings of a deal to address it at the deadline, but while Stearns shared he was comfortable with Taylor/McNeil the rest of the season, he was asked about Gilbert's recent play and whether he's on the team's radar for center field.\\n\\\"Drew\u2019s doing a tremendous job,\\\" Stearns said. \\\"I think to his credit, he\u2019s putting himself on the radar a little bit and deserves a lot of credit for that. Both offensively and defensively, he\u2019s taken a step forward over the next month or two.\\\"\\nStearns didn't necessarily answer the question, but gave his flowers to the 24-year-old who has turned his offensive game up with Syracuse.\\nEntering Friday, Gilbert was hitting .310 with a .990 OPS over the last 30 days, and that doesn't include the power performance he put on in Syracuse's game against Omaha.\\nGilbert went 3-for-4 with two home runs.\\n\\\"He's doing a tremendous his job. And to his credit, he's putting himself on the radar\\\" - David Stearns on Drew Gilbert in center field pic.twitter.com/DuS2UhXz0q\\nThat offensive outburst raised his batting average to .248, his OBP to .351 and his OPS to .796 in 78 games in Triple-A. Across 17 games in July, Gilbert is hitting .338 with six home runs while driving in 17 RBI a posting an OPS of 1.126.\\nEntering Friday, Taylor is hitting .209 with two home runs and 17 RBI to go with his .570 OPS across 91 games. McNeil, in 68 games entering Friday, is hitting better. He's averaging .251 with nine home runs and 32 RBI, but splits time between the outfield and infield.\\nWhile Jesse Winker continues to recover on the IL, Gilbert could be the left-handed bat the Mets are looking for to pair with Taylor. Stearns made it clear on Friday that upgrading the position with an external option isn't a priority.\\n\\\"I\u2019m comfortable with the setup we have right now,\\\" Stearns said of his centerfielders. \\\"Mendy is doing a great job of finding the right days for Jeff to be out there and for Tyrone to be out there.

Speaking with the media in San Francisco ahead of the team's series opener against the Giants, Stearns said talks with the Orioles had been going on for a couple of weeks and this was the time to push the deal through.\\nSoto will be the Mets' second high-leverage southpaw out of the pen -- along with the returning Brooks Raley -- and Stearns was asked whether getting that second lefty was his first priority.\\n\\\"It was important, you never know whether you\u2019ll be able to line up,\\\" Stearns said. \\\"Not sure how many lefty relievers are going to be traded this deadline. We weren\u2019t certain, but with the injuries we had from that side of the pen over the course of the season, we recognize the importance an arm from the left side can potentially have down the stretch and into October. It was something we definitely wanted to accomplish.\\\"\\nTeams aren't usually content with dealing for just one reliever at this time of the season. The Mets are likely to keep searching for more quality arms for the bullpen and Stearns is keeping the door open for more trades.\\n\\\"We\u2019re still talking. There\u2019s still the ability to upgrade our bullpen,\\\" he said. \\\"We\u2019re certainly not going to close the door on it.\\\"\\nHe later added, \\\"Wherever we can upgrade the team, we\u2019re going to try to do that. We\u2019ll continue to have discussions on the bullpen. We\u2019re not going to close the door on other aspects of the team. But as we said all along, the bullpen is the priority and probably remains that way.\\\"\\nBut what about the rotation? There have been reports that the Mets have checked in on starters like Dylan Cease and Sandy Alcantara.\\nWhile Stearns wouldn't say he's not in the market for an arm for the rotation, he made it clear that it's not high on his list of deals to make.\\n\\\"I like our starting rotation. Our current five is a very talented set of five,\\\" Stearns said. \\\"We\u2019re still in the process of building some of those guys up. And that\u2019s unusual to happen this time of the year, where you\u2019re doing that with multiple starters. That\u2019s the spot we\u2019re in right now.\u00a0Because of that, it puts a little extra burden on the bullpen\u2026But we know as we go through this over the next two months, we\u2019re going to need to ask more for more out of starters. We\u2019ll get there, we\u2019re not there quite yet.\\\"\\nCurrently, the Mets have David Peterson, Frankie Montas, Clay Holmes, Kodai Senga and Sean Manaea as the starting five. Senga and Manaea are coming off injuries and have not been built up, while Holmes, a converted reliever, has reached a workload he's never had in his career.\\nStearns and the organization are in a tricky spot, but the second-year Mets POBO believes in his starters. But offered the caveat that if there's a difference-maker available, they'll be checking.\\n\\\"I think if you\u2019re going to add to the team in general, you try to raise the ceiling of the team. That\u2019s how I look at that group,\\\" he said. \\\"Again, you don\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s going to be available and what\u2019s ultimately going to be traded. Acquiring starting pitching at this time of year is pretty difficult. I don\u2019t know how many 'raise the ceiling' type of players are going to be traded in that segment. If those guys are available, we\u2019ll be involved.\\\"\\n\\n\\nAnd what about the lineup? There's been plenty of talk regarding the Mets' pursuit of an outfield bat and whether they should. Like other aspects of the team, Stearns maintains he'll look into all opportunities to improve the team, but is comfortable and complimentary of how Jeff McNeil and Tyrone Taylor have played in center this season.\\n\\\"I\u2019m comfortable with the setup we have right now,\\\" Stearns said of his centerfielders. \\\"Mendy is doing a great job of finding the right days for Jeff to be out there and for Tyrone to be out there. It\u2019s two skill sets that complement each other, so\u00a0I\u2018m comfortable with that. Like with the rest of the team, we\u2019re going to explore areas of upgrades and that\u2019s one of them.\\\"\\nTaylor is having a tough year offensively. In 91 games entering Friday, Taylor is hitting .209 with two home runs and 17 RBI to go with his .570 OPS. McNeil, in 68 games entering Friday, is hitting better. He's averaging .251 with nine home runs and 32 RBI, but splits time between the outfield and infield.\\nWhen asked if he believes he needs to add a bat of any kind at the deadline, Stearns, again, was complimentary of how his team has played so far.\\n\\\"I don\u2019t think we need to,\\\" he said. \\\"We have the offensive players who can help us score a lot of runs and turn the lineup over. I continue to maintain we are taking good at-bats by and large, I\u2019m growing increasingly comfortable with the length of our lineup and the contributions we\u2019re getting from the bottom half of our lineup. With that said, we have to figure out a way to score more runs. I don\u2019t think anyone would shy away from that.\\\"\\nThe 2025 MLB trade deadline is set for Thursday, July 31, at 6 p.m.\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 01:19:22 +0000\\n        Source: SNY\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Mets acquire LHP Gregory Soto in deal with Orioles\\n        Description: The Mets have made their first bullpen addition ahead of the trade deadline, as they've acquired LHP Gregory Soto in a deal with the Orioles.\\n        Link: https://sny.tv/articles/mets-acquiring-lhp-gregory-soto-orioles\\n        Content: The Mets have made their first bullpen addition ahead of the trade deadline.\\nNew York has acquired LHP Gregory Soto in a trade with the Orioles, as first reported by SNY's Andy Martino.\\n\\\"This is a guy who is used to pitching in this league in high leverage, not to mention he's a lefty,\\\" said Mets manager Carlos Mendoza before Friday's game at the San Francisco Giants . \\\"Upper-90s sinker.

Obviously a piece that will help us, and I'm excited about it.\\\"\\nRight-handed pitching prospects Cameron Foster and Wellington Arecena are heading to Baltimore as part of the deal, which is pending medicals.\\nArecena, the 19th-ranked prospect in the Mets' system according to MLB Pipeline, is a 20-year-old right-hander who has pitched to a 2.38 ERA and 1.13 WHIP while striking out an incredible 84 batters across 17 appearances in High-A this season.\\nFoster is a bit older at 26, but he's also enjoying a strong season and recently made the jump to Triple-A. He's struggling a bit at the new level, but has a 2.97 ERA and 1.05 WHIP over 21 outings on the year.\\nThis marks the third time in Soto's career that he's been traded.\\nHe first broke into the league with the Tigers, but after four seasons he was shipped off to the Phillies, whom he spent a year and a half with before they traded him to Baltimore ahead of the 2023 deadline.\\nThe 30-year-old has a 3.94 ERA, 1.29 WHIP, 44 strikeouts, and 17 holds over 45 appearances.\\nHe's been particularly effective against opposing southpaws, holding them to .138 average and .547 OPS.\\nNow in the Big Apple, he'll team up with Brooks Raley to give the Mets two steady left-handed options.\\n\\\"Definitely helps,\\\" Mendoza said. \\\"Grateful and thankful that the guys that have been here, they continuously help us. Whether it's righties, lefties, there's been a lot of new faces walking through those doors. We got Raley back and we see the impact right away.\\n\\\"Another lefty allows me to deploy one of them earlier in the game and the other in the later innings.

The Phillies bats provided the glory.\\nWalker gave all he had in his, somewhat unknown, pitching tank through 5.2 innings and Kyle Schwarber and J.T. Realmuto provided the needed power as the Phillies bulled their way to a 12-5 win over the Yankees. Schwarber belted two more home runs and picked up his 1,00th career hit on the first homer, which was caught by a Phillies fan. After the game, Schwarber met with the three friends and gave them each a baseball and took some pictures with them.\\n\u201cI\u2019ve said all along I don\u2019t know where we\u2019d be without him,\u201d said Rob Thomson of Schwarber. \u201cComes up with big hit after big hit after big hit. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d\\nFamously bounced from starter to reliever and back to starter throughout the season, it\u2019s pretty much anybody\u2019s guess how much the hulking right-hander is asked to give on any given outing. Well, he and Thomson certainly know, though no one knows how the outing may unwind.\\nTo that end, there was a \u201chold your breath\u201d kind of half inning for the Phillies earlier in the game, before they started bashing the ball all over the Bronx.\\nWalker loafed out of the visiting team\u2019s dugout at Yankee Stadium Friday night to take the mound for the sixth inning. In the previous five innings, he had only thrown 65 pitches and allowed a pair of solo home runs. It was an outing you had to be more than pleased with up to that point. As Walker strolled (he doesn\u2019t exactly use up much energy when there\u2019s no need and added to that a sore ankle) to the mound, Aaron Judge, he of the .345 average and 37 home runs,\u00a0 was grabbing a bat to get ready to leadoff the inning.\\n\u201cHe was at 65 pitches after the fifth,\u201d Thomson said. \u201cAnd his limit was probably 85. \u00a0So we were going hitter to hitter right there. We had (Tanner) Banks ready to go.\u201d Walker got a groundout from Judge on four pitches, and retired Cody Bellinger, who earlier homered, on a flyout with six pitches. After getting Giancarlo Stanton down 0-2, the DH hit the sixth pitch of the at-bat into the Yankees bullpen for a 3-2 lead.\\n\u201cHe was great,\u201d said Thomson. \u201cHe gave up three home runs but they\u2019re all solo. He didn\u2019t walk a guy. They got a lot of soft contact. I thought he was really good.\u201d\\nAll this came after Walker tweaked his right ankle on a bouncing ball up the middle in the second inning. After a lengthy meeting on the mound with trainers and Thomson, Walker waved them off and continued.\\n\u201cI thought it went well,\u201d said Walker of his 5.2 innings in which he allowed six hits and three earned runs. \u201cGot into the sixth and really wanted to get that last out but just left it over the middle. Supposed to be a two-seam in there, try to get some weak contact. I thought overall it was good.\u201d\\nThe Phillies offense didn\u2019t have much weak contact on the night as Trea Turner got on base five times as he and Schwarber combined to go 7-for-10 with six runs scored.\\nBefore the game, Thomson spoke of the recent uptick in the offensive production from Realmuto. Thomson alluded to when Realmuto is at his best, he hits the ball to center and right field.\\nMaybe the veteran catcher got wind of Thomson\u2019s remarks and wanted to show that\u2019s not all he can do. Realmuto turned perfectly into a Luke Weaver changeup and launched it deep into the left-field seats to give the Phillies a 6-3 lead in the seventh.\\n\u201cI feel like mechanically I\u2019ve been in a better spot recently, starting to feel good, my timing\u2019s felt better and seeing the ball better,\u201d said Realmuto. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s heading in the right direction. It\u2019s mostly timing with me. I\u2019m more of a line drive and focus on right field hitter, but I\u2019ll catch those mistakes out in front a little more often.\u201d\\nThere is pretty much nothing Schwarber isn\u2019t doing right at the plate as his first home run of the night tied the game at 2-2 in the fifth and his two-run shot in the eighth upped the lead to 8-5.\\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got such a really good group here,\u201d Schwarber said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a lot of the same faces for quite a while now. Obviously, you keep adding and new faces every single year. Obviously, we\u2019ve gone through a lot of different things. We also want to create some new experiences as well. We\u2019ve just got to keep going about our business, putting our heads down and keep working and see where we\u2019re at at the end of the year.\u201d\\nIn the meantime, don\u2019t miss what Schwarber is doing now, because it\u2019s pretty special.\\n\\n        Published: Fri, 25 Jul 2025 23:31:25 +0000\\n        Source: NBC Sports Philadelphia\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: History!

And I say that because, I watched Barry Bonds and the season he had. I was in center field for it. And what Barry did was hands-down one of the greatest seasons you can have.\\n\u201cShawn Green is a memory you have, I think Shawn hit four homers in a game in Dodger Stadium. But tonight was special. This kid continues to have jaw-dropping moments. And to witness that tonight was pretty special for all of us.\u201d\\nThe Athletics took Kurtz with the No. 4 overall pick on July 14 last year, and they clearly hit a home run with that selection.\\nJust over a year later, the Wake Forest product arguably is the hottest big-league hitter at the moment.\\nIt\u2019s a remarkable ascension for the 22-year-old.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely crazy,\u201d Kurtz told Caray and Braden. \u201cTo think a year ago I was probably in Arizona right now, right after the draft and just getting ready to go out and play in Stockton and now I\u2019m here and today kind of happened, it\u2019s insane. I kinda, I don\u2019t know what to say Dallas. I mean I got no idea.\u201d\\nMaybe even more remarkable is that Kurtz\u2019s family made it to Houston just in time to watch his otherworldly performance.\\n\u201cTo see Pops and Mom there and the godparents as well, it\u2019s pretty awesome to have them here,\u201d Kurtz told Caray and Braden. \u201c[They] just got in this morning, so going to be here is really cool.\u201d\\nThere are over two months left in the 2025 season, but it might be a safe bet to start inscribing Kurtz\u2019s name on the AL Rookie of the Year award.

Within moments, an otherwise empty ballpark was echoing with cheers and applause, the fans shouting Buehler\u2019s name as he acknowledged them with a wave of his hand.\\n\u201cThat was really cool,\u201d Buehler said later, the moment reminding him of a conversation he had with Dodgers broadcaster Orel Hershiser (a World Series hero of a different generation who became a mentor of Buehler\u2019s during his time with the team).\\nRead more: Beyond the bullpen, how aggressive will the Dodgers be at the MLB trade deadline?\\n\u201cTalking to Orel about some of that stuff that he\u2019s gone through and the way people react to him, I think it\u2019s obviously two different situations,\u201d he added. \u201cBut for the fans walking around to yell at me, I kind of imagine in L.A. it\u2019ll be like that for a while, I hope.\u201d\\nIndeed, if there was any doubt about how Buehler\u2019s Dodgers tenure was destined to be remembered, his role in last year\u2019s World Series enshrined it in legendary status.\\nNo, the right-hander didn\u2019t quite reach the Cy Young-winning expectations many had when he first came up as a highly touted prospect with a big fastball and fiery mound presence. For as dominant as he was from 2018-2021, when he went 39-13 with a 2.82 earned-run average and two All-Star selections, the end of his seven-year stint was derailed by a 2022 Tommy John surgery (the second of his career) and a disappointing regular-season performance upon his return in 2024 (when he was 1-6 in the regular season with a 5.38 ERA).\\nBuehler\u2019s best Dodger moments, though, always came in the postseason: From his division-clinching gem in Game 163 as a rookie in 2018, to his 1.80 ERA in five starts during the Dodgers\u2019 2020 World Series run, to when he took the ball on short rest twice in a failed title defense in 2021, to his 10 consecutive scoreless innings in the final two rounds of last year\u2019s postseason most of all; an unexpected star turn following his post-Tommy John struggles throughout the summer.\\n\u201cThat moment means a lot to all of us, that we were a part of it with the city and the fans that came out every day for us there,\u201d he said, while talking to reporters in the Red Sox\u2019s home dugout. \u201cI think it would have been hard to leave that for anywhere \u2014 except for here.\u201d\\nWhile Buehler expressed interest in remaining with the Dodgers ahead of his free agency last winter, his eventual departure became clear in the first week of the offseason.\\nThe team didn\u2019t extend him a one-year, $21.05 million qualifying offer \u2014 which ended up being the same amount he signed for with the Red Sox. The Dodgers instead went after Blake Snell with a $182-million contract, and won the January sweepstakes for Japanese phenom Roki Sasaki.\\n\u201cIt was an interesting situation. I think there\u2019s obviously two sides to that situation,\u201d Buehler said when reflecting back on his free agency. \u201cWe had conversations about it, we talked through it. And they went and signed guys that they wanted to sign. And I signed with a place that I wanted to play. It kind of is what it is.\u201d\\nRead more: Shaikin: Walker Buehler struggling to rediscover his Dodgers World Series magic with Red Sox\\nIn hindsight, it was an outcome neither side  seems to  regret.\\nIn Buehler\u2019s absence, the Dodgers have managed to work around first-half injuries to several key starters, and are on track to have a potential postseason rotation featuring Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Tyler Glasnow, Shohei Ohtani and Snell (who could return from a shoulder injury after one last minor league rehab start with triple-A Oklahoma City on Saturday).\\nMeanwhile, Buehler said he has enjoyed playing for the Red Sox, even though he has regressed with a woeful 5.72 ERA (sixth-worst in the majors among 107 pitchers with at least 80 innings).\\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a really fun year, outside of some of the playing stuff for me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut my family and me, we\u2019re loving it here and have felt really very welcomed here, as well, just like we were in L.A.\u201d\\nBuehler has been better lately, giving up just three earned runs in his last 18 innings to help the Red Sox maintain the final wild-card spot in the American League.\\nHis next start, fittingly, will come in Sunday\u2019s series-finale against the Dodgers.\\n\u201cIt'll be interesting,\u201d Buehler said with a laugh. \u201cObviously, I was one of the last of the wave coming up there. So I\u2019ve kind of got little bits and pieces of it playing against Joc [Pederson] and [Cody Bellinger] and Corey [Seager]. So it\u2019ll be nine of those for me, I guess.\u201d\\nBuehler wished he could have squared off against Clayton Kershaw; something he said he and the future Hall of Fame left-hander (who will instead pitch Saturday\u2019s game) joked about while meeting up on Thursday\u2019s off day.\\nStill, Buehler added, \\\"I think you just try to keep it as normal as you can. Obviously it'll be a little awkward or funny or whatever. But I don't know. At the end of the day, we're all playing a sport for a paycheck. The goal is go and to get one over on them. I don't think the preparation against them is really different.\\\"\\nFriday, on the other hand, was a day for nostalgia, with Buehler receiving his World Series ring from Dodgers manager Dave Roberts and most of the remaining players from last year\u2019s team during pregame batting practice.\\nRead more: Freddie Freeman's walk-off hit saves the day, lifts Dodgers to win over Twins\\n\u201cI was very fortunate to be drafted and developed and get to spend so much time there,\u201d Buehler said. \u201cShould credit a lot of good success that I've had to them, and how they handled and treated me.

Even then, there was still plenty of depth in the bullpen because of everything else that has gone on this week.\\nThe Giants are currently carrying four right-handers who could be described as long relievers, the result of optioning Hayden Birdsong and losing Landen Roupp to elbow inflammation .\\nThe rotation, a strength for much of the first half, is leaking oil, and the staff ace is not exempt.\\nWebb was charged with six earned in an 8-1 loss to the New York Mets. He has given up 16 earned over his last three starts \u2013 the worst such stretch of his career.\\nWhat\u2019s going on?\\n\u201cIf I knew, I would have fixed it by now,\u201d he said. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s just not good.\u201d\\nIf there is something that is bothering Webb physically, he won\u2019t use it as an excuse.\\nAsked about his workload on Friday, he said he feels fine and pointed out that this is what he gets paid to do. \u201cI\u2019ve got to be better,\u201d he repeated.\\nThe latest disappointing start came a few hours after the Giants announced that Roupp will miss at least two starts with tightness in his right elbow.\\nEarlier this week, they sent Birdsong back to Triple-A after he failed to record an out in a nightmare start against the Atlanta Braves.\\nThere is a bullpen game on the schedule for Sunday and that likely won\u2019t change, even after Webb tied a season-low for outs recorded. The group that walked in from the bullpen late Friday night included Carson Seymour and Sean Hjelle , both of whom can give Melvin some length.\\nTo get through Friday\u2019s loss, the manager used Tristan Beck and Spencer Bivens , among others.\\nBarring a disastrous start from Robbie Ray on Saturday, the Giants will go to their deep pen on Sunday and then figure out what to do with Roupp\u2019s turn. Carson Whisenhunt and Kai-Weig Teng seem to be the leading options, with the hope that Roupp will be back in a couple of weeks.\\nThe Giants also could trade for reinforcements over the next six days, although on Friday it was hard to make the argument that this team should push too many additional chips into the center of the table.\\nIn front of a sellout crowd, the lineup repeatedly let Clay Holmes off the hook. The loss was the fifth in seven games since the All-Star break.\\nIn the first half, the slow stretches could be put just about entirely on the offense. But over the past week, question marks have popped up with the rotation, which went seven deep at the start of the season and now has just three healthy starters.\\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to put the team in a better spot. I\u2019ve got to be better,\u201d Webb added. \u201cIt sucks losing Roupp \u2014 honestly he\u2019s probably throwing the best out of all of us right now. It sucks losing him and I know he\u2019s upset about it, but we all just have to step up and be better than what I did today.\u201d\\nDownload and follow the Giants Talk Podcast\\n\\n        Published: Fri, 25 Jul 2025 23:19:38 +0000\\n        Source: NBC Sports BayArea\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: What we learned as Giants' offense, Logan Webb come out flat in loss to Mets\\n        Description: The Giants offense and Logan Webb came out flat in another lackluster loss to the New York Mets on Friday at Oracle Park.\\n        Link: https://www.nbcsportsbayarea.com/mlb/san-francisco-giants/logan-webb-new-york-mets/1863910/?partner=yahoo\\n        Content: What we learned as Giants' offense, Logan Webb come out flat in loss to Mets originally appeared on NBC Sports Bay Area\\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Between innings on Friday night, the Giants\u2019 stadium\u00a0operations crew played a game of \u201cRemembering Some Guys.\u201d Russ Ortiz, Tyler Walker and Jean Machi were all at Oracle Park, and they were shown on the scoreboard and remembered as Forever Giants.\\nThe former\u00a0Giants pitchers were not treated to a good performance.\\nLogan Webb had a third straight rough start and the lineup couldn\u2019t keep the Atlanta vibes going, losing 8-1 to the New York Mets.\\nAs they kicked off a six-game homestand against the Mets and Pittsburgh Pirates that will lead right into the trade deadline, the Giants fell for the fifth time in seven games since the All-Star break.\\nHere are three things to know from a disappointing start to the homestand:\\nWebb pitched well in the All-Star Game, but the rest of this month has been surprisingly rocky. He lasted just four innings Friday, tying a season low, and he tied a season high by allowing six earned runs. Webb gave up just 10 earned runs in his first 10 starts at Oracle Park this season, but he has allowed 12 earned runs over his past two home starts against the Los Angeles Dodgers and Mets.\\nFriday\u2019s trouble started early, after Webb gave up a leadoff double and a single. The Mets scored two in the first, and Francisco Lindor hit a solo homer in the third. Webb gave up three singles and walked one in the fourth before recovering to strike out Lindor and Juan Soto, but the damage had been done. The staff ace had a 2.62 ERA after a quality start in Sacramento at the beginning of July, but it\u2019s now up to 3.38.\\nWhen he walked into Oracle Park this week, it was Matt Gage\u2019s first visit since 2015, when he was a recent Giants draft pick who took part in their January rookie camp \u2014 which included a run to the Golden Gate Bridge and another day when prospects ran up and down every set of stairs in the upper deck.\\nGage, now 32, never made it to the big leagues in his first go-around with the Giants, but he has pitched well since returning this month. The lefty opened the seventh by blowing a fastball past Lindor and then got a pop-up from Soto and a groundout from Pete Alonso. In four scoreless innings with the Giants, Gage has allowed just one hit.\\nRafael Devers made his second start at first base, and it was uneventful. Devers looked comfortable, and his bothersome back and groin didn\u2019t seem to be impacted by a cold night at Oracle Park.\\nDevers went 1-for-4 at the plate with an early double that helped get the Giants on the board. After Heliot Ramos led off the first with a single, Devers hooked a changeup from Clay Holmes into the right field corner. Ramos scored on a groundout by Willy Adames.\\nDownload and follow the Giants Talk Podcast\\n\\n        Published: Fri, 25 Jul 2025 22:06:02 +0000\\n        Source: NBC Sports BayArea\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Nick Kurtz's historic 4-HR barrage is latest proof that 'The Big Amish' is slugging his way into AL Rookie of the Year race\\n        Description: The Athletics' first baseman, along with rookie shortstop Jacob Wilson, gives the team a young hitting tandem to build around.\\n        Link: https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/nick-kurtzs-historic-4-hr-barrage-is-latest-proof-that-the-big-amish-is-slugging-his-way-into-al-rookie-of-the-year-race-220255810.html\\n        Content: For the first time in his young career, 22-year-old first baseman Nick Kurtz was named AL Player of the Week on Monday after his highly productive showing in the Athletics\u2019 first series of the second half vs. Cleveland.\\nWith the All-Star festivities having put a pause on the regular season, this award, doled out weekly by the league office, didn\u2019t cover the usual sample of six or seven games played over a week. Instead, it highlighted just the first weekend after the break. And in that abbreviated sample, Kurtz mashed to an outstanding degree, collecting multiple hits in all three games at Progressive Field, including five of the extra-base variety.\\nOn the surface, it\u2019s a modest accomplishment for the rookie first baseman, the first official accolade in a career that promises to feature plenty more. At the same time, \u201cplayer of the week\u201d wholly undersells what Kurtz has been doing at the plate lately. Because he was not just the star of this past week(end). He has been the best hitter in baseball for the past nine weeks .\\nKurtz put the baseball world on further notice Friday with a historic night at the plate, as he became the first rookie in MLB history to hit four home runs in a game in a 15-3 blowout of the Houston Astros . He went 6-for-6 with eight RBI and 19 total bases in what many have called one of the greatest offensive performances ever. It was enough to make Kurtz the new betting favorite to win AL Rookie of the Year, according to BetMGM .\\n[ Join or create a Yahoo Fantasy Football league for the 2025 NFL season ]\\nNICK KURTZ BECOMES THE FIRST ROOKIE WITH A FOUR-HOMER GAME IN MLB HISTORY \ud83e\udd2f (via @MLB ) pic.twitter.com/W8IQtfXk5x\\nThe A's broadcasters toasted the feat in the booth with a butter churn celebration, paying homage to Kurtz's \\\"Big Amish\\\" nickname, given to him to acknowledge his Lancaster, Pennsylvania, roots.\\n\\\"It's hard to think about this day being kind of real. It still feels like a dream,\\\" Kurtz said postgame via ESPN .\\nBut it's real. Since the end of May, neither Aaron Judge nor Cal Raleigh nor Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr. nor Kurtz\u2019s NL Player of the Week counterpart, red-hot trade candidate Eugenio Su\u00e1rez , has been as dominant with the bat as the A\u2019s rookie. Over the past 42 games before Friday's explosion, Kurtz was hitting .327/.408/.782 with 18 home runs, good for a 1.190 OPS and 217 wRC+ that were both tops in baseball.\\n\\n\u201cI think Nick's put himself, in a very short time, in conversation about Rookie of the Year,\u201d A\u2019s manager Mark Kotsay said in Cleveland. \u201cWe've got one on the team right now that's probably a little ahead of him in Jacob [Wilson]. But it's fun to watch these two, and it's going to be fun to watch them over the next 64 games and the progress they're able to make.\u201d\\nIndeed, Wilson\u2019s marvelous first half, which led to him starting the All-Star Game at shortstop for the AL, has somewhat overshadowed Kurtz\u2019s prolonged hot streak. But make no mistake: Both are succeeding to a degree achieved by very few rookie hitters as they emerge as one of the most promising young position-player duos in baseball.\\n\u201cNick, he's still learning the league,\u201d Kotsay said. \u201cJacob got a little head start on him.\\n\u201cBut Nick seems to be a quick learner.\u201d\\nThree weeks of torching Triple-A pitching earned Kurtz his big-league call-up on April 23, roughly nine months after he was selected fourth overall in the 2024 MLB Draft. It wasn\u2019t smooth sailing at first: After he hit his first home run on May 13, Kurtz fell into an 0-for-21 skid that plummeted his OPS to a paltry .558.\\nBut Kurtz didn\u2019t panic. And those who observed how he went about his business in the earliest days of his big-league tenure were unsurprised when he began to not just dig himself out of that hole but also flourish in spectacular fashion upon finding his footing.\\n\u201cHe had to go through some struggles, like everybody does, and he didn't press,\u201d A's hitting coach Chris Cron said. \u201cIt wasn't a major deal. Of course he wanted to do well, but it wasn't the end of the world.\u201d\\n\u201cWhen you come billed with the kind of power he came with, to not be able to tap into that readily and immediately, I think you would see some guys start to scramble,\u201d former A\u2019s pitcher and current broadcaster Dallas Braden said. \u201cInstead, what he did was cut the swing down and spray the baseball all over the yard until he got comfortable to a point where he could dip back into that power pool.\u201d\\nIt took some time for Kurtz to tweak his patented patient approach, which he mastered as an amateur, to fit the unique challenge of hitting major-league pitching.\\n\u201cIf you wait for your pitch, you're probably striking out on three pitches,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's all about adjusting on the fly and pitch-to-pitch. Some guys, you need to be aggressive on pitches that aren't necessarily your pitch. When I first got up, I was trying to be a little too patient. Being down 0-1, 0-2, 1-2 so much \u2026 this game is so hard.\u201d\\nKurtz realized early on that he needed to take control of his at-bats, rather than letting the pitcher dictate the terms of engagement. And behind the scenes, he was making adjustments to allow his strengths to manifest against more daunting competition.\\n\u201cHis ability just to communicate what he's trying to do, understand the information that we're throwing out there \u2014 that doesn't just happen with a snap of the finger,\u201d Cron said. \u201cYou tell him something, he can absorb, and he can apply. Application of the information is the hardest thing to grasp, and he does that.\u201d\\nSaid All-Star teammate Brent Rooker: \u201cTo have as high-level approaches as he has as a 22-year-old, and then to also go out and execute them and execute them with the power that he does \u2026 That makes him stand out.\u201d\\nSoon enough, Kurtz began to better understand when to unleash his thunderous left-handed swing \u2014 \u201cIt's about playing the game and the situations,\u201d he said \u2014 and the results followed.\\n\u201cOnce he found himself in 2-0, 2-1s, 3-0, 3-1s,\u201d Braden said, \u201cnow it's go time.\u201d\\nWith that, Kurtz took off. On May 20 , he snapped his hitless skid with a single and a home run against the Angels. Two more homers followed the next day. A strained left hip flexor put Kurtz on the injured list later that week and threatened to derail his newfound momentum, but the brief injury scare was no trouble. It took just one minor-league rehab game \u2014 he homered, of course \u2014 before Kurtz rejoined the A\u2019s lineup and resumed raking.\\nAs the home runs kept coming, each seismic swing seemed to carry greater weight than the last: A go-ahead blast off Royals closer Carlos Est\u00e9vez in the top of the ninth in Kansas City. Two walk-off homers against the Astros off elite relievers in Bryan Abreu and Josh Hader. A titanic, three-run shot in Detroit \u2014 the only home run ball to reach the shrubbery beyond the center-field wall at Comerica Park this season \u2014 that provided the only runs in a 3-0 victory over the Tigers. And that magical Friday night against the Astros.\\n\\nWhether in pregame batting practice or in high-stakes battles against some of the best pitchers on the planet, the power that was promised during Kurtz\u2019s brief time as a prospect has consistently been on display this season. Most remarkably, Kurtz\u2019s ability to clear the fence from foul pole to foul pole is nearly unrivaled; not even Judge has hit more home runs to the opposite field or straightaway center since the start of June .\\nAnd when Kurtz is going good, the homers tend to come in bunches. It happened last spring, when he hit 14 homers in a 10-game span after a cold start to his junior season at Wake Forest. It happened before his call-up this year, when he hit seven homers across 12 games in Triple-A. Now it\u2019s happening at the highest level, with a five-homers-in-six-games run in June and an 11-homers-in-14-games stretch in July.\\nKurtz did his best to describe what it\u2019s like to be so locked in: \\\"It's probably one of the best feelings, knowing when you're up there \u2014 honestly, it doesn't matter whether you get a hit or not \u2014 but I know what I'm feeling in my swing, I know exactly where [the bat] is going. I'm seeing the ball \u2014 it's huge right now. It's kind of what you dream about.\u201d\\n\\\"It amazes me,\u201d said Rooker, who was also a first-round draft pick out of college but didn\u2019t blossom into an impact big-league bat until his age-28 season. \u201cI was a very, very good college player. And if you had thrown me in the big leagues at 22, I would\u2019ve absolutely had no chance.\u201d\\n[ Get more A's news: Athletics team feed ]\\nRooker\u2019s more gradual development only increases his appreciation for how Kurtz and Wilson have hit the ground running as rookies.\\n\u201cTheir ability to just jump right in and have success immediately and adjust as quickly as they have, I don't think people realize how difficult that is,\u201d he said.\\nAdding to the unique dynamic of this unrivaled rookie duo is how drastically different they are as players. Wilson is a skinny, right-handed shortstop who thrives on a hyper-aggressive approach and succeeds thanks to his nearly unparalleled bat-to-ball skills. Kurtz is a gargantuan, left-handed first baseman who whiffs often but pulverizes the ball so frequently that the punchouts are entirely tolerable.\\n\\n\u201cI don't think there's one way, from a hitting standpoint, to tell somebody how to do it,\u201d Kotsay said. \u201cJacob has his unique style. He's a bat-to-ball guy that puts it in play and sometimes seems to have a magic wand where he can hit it where he wants to. I played with a guy like that \u2014 Tony Gwynn \u2014 who had that magic wand.\\n\u201cAnd for Nick, when he touches it, he impacts the baseball, and he can leave anywhere in the yard. They're definitely two different styles of hitters, but they have an advanced approach for how young they are in knowing who they are and knowing what they're trying to do.\u201d\\nSaid Wilson of his counterpart: \u201cWhen we drafted him, it was obviously a huge bat for us to go out and get, and as you can see, it's translating to the big-league level pretty nicely right now. Definitely happy to have him on the team, excited to hopefully play with him for a very long time.\u201d\\nKurtz\u2019s and Wilson\u2019s Baseball Savant pages are opposites to a spectacular degree , a fitting reflection of each player leaning all the way in on what he does best. To Rooker, this is a great sign.\\n\\\"The key to having success here is knowing what you're good at and then just being as good as you possibly can be at those things,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody here is doing something at an elite level. ... You have to figure out what that thing is, and you have to be as good as you possibly can at that. There's a ton of value, obviously, in trying to improve your weaknesses. [But] I think there's more value in finding your superpower and doing that as well as you possibly can. And I think those two guys are perfect examples of that.\u201d\\n\\nFor as impressive of a start to his career as Kurtz has had, he knows this is just the beginning. \\\"I put zero expectations on myself in Year 1,\u201d he said. \u201cI had no idea what I was getting into.\u201d\\nHe also will not stay this hot forever; another round of adjustments is surely in store, a regression to reality that will put his advanced aptitude to the test once again. And for the Athletics as a whole \u2014 a franchise in a transition between cities, with an inexperienced yet ascendent roster still figuring out how to translate talent into victories \u2014 every game is another opportunity to grow together.\\n\u201cThat's the best part about what we've developed here with some of those young guys \u2014 they're coming up together,\u201d Cron said. \u201cAnd these two guys, Jacob, with his lineage, with his dad playing [in the big leagues], he's been around the game. The maturity of Nick Kurtz is off the charts. Physically, they're not the same, but they have this mindset of, \u2018Yes, \u2019 \u2014 without being braggadocious \u2014 \u2018I'm a big leaguer.\u2019 And there's nothing that really fazes either one of them.\u201d\\nVeterans such as Rooker will continue to play a critical role in these young players\u2019 development, and Kurtz is quick to credit the A's DH, as well as the recently released Seth Brown. But Kurtz also knows that the franchise\u2019s future depends on his generation becoming the driving force behind the team's success.\\n\u201cWe might not all know the answers,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we're in it together, and we're gonna figure it out.\u201d\\n        Published: Fri, 25 Jul 2025 22:02:55 +0000\\n        Source: Yahoo Sports\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Jazz Chisholm Jr. breaks down new Mets reliever Gregory Soto: 'He\u2019s one of the best'\\n        Description: Yankees' Jazz Chisholm Jr. was willing to provide a scouting report on the Mets\u2019 newest acquisition, LHP Gregory Soto.\\n        Link: https://sny.tv/articles/jazz-chisholm-jr-breaks-down-new-mets-reliever-gregory-soto\\n        Content: Hey Jazz Chisholm Jr. , did you know that you have the most at-bats of any Yankee against Gregory Soto ?\\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Chisholm says, standing in the Yankee dugout Friday afternoon. \u201cAnd probably the least amount of hits.\u201d\\nWell, tied for the least, with zero.

For that reason, Baldwin remains available in 80 percent of Yahoo leagues, even after the Braves turned him into a full-time player by putting Marcell Ozuna on the bench last weekend. He\u2019s since started seven straight games, four at catcher and three at DH.\\nWith Ozuna seemingly likely to be moved at the deadline, Baldwin should get all of the playing time he can handle the rest of the way, making him the NL Rookie of the Year favorite. He\u2019s certainly looked the part thus far in batting .284/.353/.479 with 11 homers. The league as a whole this year has 27% more hard-hit balls than strikeouts. Baldwin has 123% more (89 hard-hit balls, 40 strikeouts). His 50.9% hard-hit rate places him 31st of the 268 batters with 200 plate appearances. Will Smith and Hunter Goodwin are the only catchers hitting at least .280 with at least 10 homers.\\nMaybe Baldwin will wear down some, but all of the DH time will help. If the Braves pivot and trade Sean Murphy instead of Ozuna, I would drop Baldwin in my rankings some. Right now, though, I have him eighth among catchers, and I\u2019d be willing to move on from guys like J.T. Realmuto, Alejandro Kirk, Shea Langeliers, Logan O\u2019Hoppe and Agustin Ram\u00edrez in order to add him.\\nIt\u2019s hard to spin being traded out of Coors Field as a good thing, but getting away from the disaster of an organization that is the Colorado Rockies might pay off for McMahon, an eternally disappointing offensive player who nevertheless possesses excellent exit velocity numbers. Those numbers are actually better than usual this season.\\nMcMahon, who was dealt to the Yankees for two pitching prospects on Friday, is currently averaging 94.0 mph off the bat, seventh best in the majors. His top-end numbers aren\u2019t as great -- for instance, he\u2019s just 46th when it comes to 90th percentile exit velocity -- but that\u2019s still a lot of hard contact. He\u2019s also hitting more flyballs and pulling the ball more than usual this year. It seems like a recipe for success, but there have been a lot of shots to the warning track thus far. He\u2019s also probably been unlucky; Statcast has him with a .466 xSLG, compared to .403 in reality. He\u2019s never experienced any sort of gap like that previously.\\nObviously, the strikeouts really hold McMahon back. He was leading the NL with 127 this season, which is remarkable for a guy playing in the league\u2019s preeminent strikeout-suppressing ballpark. The Yankees probably have some ideas on how to help him there, but one can\u2019t really expect him to improve much in the near future. If McMahon\u2019s value does come up in the short term, it will be a product of hitting in a far better lineup and sneaking balls over the right field wall in Yankee Stadium. It\u2019s a far worse offensive ballpark, but it\u2019s one that yields more homers to left-handers than Coors does. Unless the Yankees platoon him against southpaws -- they probably ought to, but I\u2019m guessing he\u2019ll be a full-timer initially -- he\u2019s probably a better rest-of-season bet today than he was yesterday.\\nBradish pitched in a game Thursday for the first time since Tommy John surgery, throwing two innings and allowing one run for High-A Aberdeen. The stadium gun had him at 94-96 mph, said MLB.com\u2019s Jake Rill , putting right back where he was before getting hurt. That bodes well for a right-hander who had emerged as one of the AL\u2019s best pitchers at the time of his injury.\\nA subpar pitcher as a rookie in 2022, Bradish busted out about a month into the 2023 season and wound up posting a 2.42 ERA and a 150/35 K/BB in his final 25 starts that year. Last season, he was just as effective, and his strikeout rate jumped from 25 percent to 33 percent in the eight starts before he got hurt. The league had a hard-hit rate of just 29 percent against his arsenal of two fastballs, a slider and a curve.\\nThat\u2019s not to say Bradish is going to experience the same sort of success right away after returning next month. He might even have a setback before then, and given that the Orioles are out of contention, any sort of setback would probably get him shut down until 2026. However, if his rehab continues to progress smoothly, he could be quite an asset over the final six weeks of the season. Those who look to wait until his rehab is complete to pick him up will probably find they missed out.\\n- I\u2019m not going to write about rotation-bound Joe Boyle again so soon after featuring him recently , but he ought to be picked up everywhere after the Rays\u2019 demotion of Taj Bradley. Instead, he\u2019s only 15 percent rostered now.\\n- The Astros\u2019 Cristian Javier doesn\u2019t need to be picked up just yet as he works his way back from Tommy John, but it was really encouraging that he averaged 93.6 mph with his fastball in his first Triple-A start. That\u2019s back where he was in 2021 and \u201922 before falling off in 2023 (92.8 mph) and 2024 (91.7). I doubt we\u2019ll ever again see the Javier of 2022 (2.54 ERA, 33% K rate in 149 IP), but on a fine Houston team, he doesn\u2019t need to be that good to offer some value.\\n        Published: Fri, 25 Jul 2025 19:52:36 +0000\\n        Source: NBC Sports\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Yankees acquire third baseman Ryan McMahon from the Rockies for pair of prospects\\n        Description: McMahon leaves the last-place Rockies for a Yankees team that\u2019s in the thick of a playoff chase.\\n        Link: https://www.nbcsports.com/mlb/news/report-yankees-acquire-third-baseman-ryan-mcmahon-from-rockies-for-prospects\\n        Content: DENVER (AP)  The New York Yankees acquired third baseman Ryan McMahon from the Colorado Rockies on Friday, giving them a veteran at a position of need as they try to stop their slide down the AL East standings.\\nThe Yankees sent pitching prospects Josh Grosz and Griffin Herring to Colorado.\\nThe 30-year-old McMahon, an All-Star a year ago, was hitting .217 with 16 home runs and 35 RBIs for last-place Colorado.

That would mean missing just two starts, although with any elbow discomfort,\u00a0there is going to be some uncertainty\u00a0about the true timetable.\\nFor now, the Giants and Roupp are optimistic that the discomfort was caught in time.\\nRoupp said he first felt some tightness after his start against the Los Angeles Dodgers on the last homestand. There was additional tightness in Atlanta on Tuesday, leading Melvin to pull Roupp after five shutout innings even though he was only at 87 pitches.\\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s pretty minor,\u201d Melvin told reporters on Friday. \u201cI think we caught it at the right time. We were kind of considering maybe just skipping him a turn, but with the IL being 15 days, it basically comes down to two starts. We\u2019re hopeful that he\u2019s going to be able to come back out after that.\u201d\\nThe Giants already had a gap in their rotation after optioning Hayden Birdsong to Triple-A on Tuesday, a day after he failed to record an out and walked four in the first inning. The first opening will arrive Sunday, and the plan is to go with a bullpen game in place of Birdsong, at least for this turn. Roupp is likely to be replaced by another young starter, and the Giants have several options.\\nCarson Seymour is already up in the big leagues and available out of the bullpen, and he is stretched out enough to make a start.\\nCarson Whisenhunt will also be an option, and that would turn into a highly-anticipated event. The lefty is the organization\u2019s best pitching prospect.\\nThe Giants are also considering Kai-Wei Teng , who struggled in four appearances last year and was taken off the 40-man roster in the offseason. Teng has been the best of the Triple-A pitchers in recent weeks and has 82 strikeouts in 52 1/3 innings this season.\\nWhen the Birdsong and Roupp spots come back around a second time, it\u2019s possible the Giants have an additional option or two. Rotation depth stands out as their biggest need ahead of the deadline, which is Thursday afternoon.\\nThe staff is confident that Birdsong will figure out his command issues and there is hope with Roupp\u2019s elbow, but both pitchers also face uncertainty. Birdsong\u2019s last start was jarring, and elbow discomfort is never to be taken lightly. Another spot in the rotation is held by Justin Verlander , who just picked up his first win but also has a 4.70 ERA.\\n\u201cLook, it feels like every team goes through it, and sometimes when it rains it pours a little bit,\u201d Melvin added. \u201cWe do have some guys we like in Triple-A as far as the depth goes, so we\u2019ll see where that goes \u2014 and we\u2019ll see what the deadline brings.\u201d\\nDownload and follow the Giants Talk Podcast\\n\\n        Published: Fri, 25 Jul 2025 18:32:19 +0000\\n        Source: NBC Sports BayArea\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Two-start pitchers: Matthew Boyd leads a strong group of options for the week of July 28\\n        Description: Zach Eflin, Max Fried and Cristopher S\u00e1nchez are among the projected two-start pitchers for the upcoming week.\\n        Link: https://sports.yahoo.com/article/two-start-pitchers-matthew-boyd-182226101.html\\n        Content: Hello and welcome to the 17th installment of our weekly two-start pitcher article for the 2025 MLB season.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI'll be here every Friday to highlight some of the best two-start pitcher options in fantasy baseball leagues for the upcoming week, as well as some streaming options to keep in mind.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThinking ahead with your weekly strategy can give you an advantage on the waiver wire and hopefully be a difference-maker in the standings at the end of the season.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is a living document, so we'll update the options below as the weekend moves along.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBefore we get into it, we'll start with a couple of notes on situations that may be unresolved or teams that may not have a two-start pitcher lined up for the upcoming week:\\n\\nSomeone should make two starts for the Braves next week, but as of now we\u2019re still not sure who that person will be after Davis Daniel was optioned back to Triple-A Gwinnett following a rough outing against the Giants. It could be Dane Dunning , but he has already been used twice out of the bullpen and wouldn\u2019t be stretched out yet. Stay tuned, we\u2019ll track this one through the weekend. The two starts we would be looking at here are at the Royals and against the Reds in a neutral location in the MLB Speedway Classic in Bristol. Tennessee.\\nIt's also not clear yet who is going to take the ball for the Angels on Monday. The Angels went with a bullpen game the last time this spot in the rotation came around, with Jake Eder logging six innings in a bulk role out of the bullpen. He has since been optioned back to Triple-A Salt Lake. Carson Fulmer would make some sense, but he pitched an inning out of the bullpen on Thursday so it\u2019s unclear if they want to go in that direction. Stay tuned.\\nWe\u2019re also still waiting for clarity on what the Dodgers are going to do. They play six games next week, so there\u2019s a chance that Yoshinobu Yamamoto will make two starts (@ Reds, @ Rays), but they\u2019re currently rolling with a modified six-man rotation as they stretch out Shohei Ohtani and they\u2019re also expecting Blake Snell to return soon, which could further complicate plans.\\nTentatively, we\u2019re expecting Jacob Misiorowski to make two starts for the Brewers next week (vs. Cubs, @ Nationals), but that\u2019s not a guarantee. Nestor Cortes looks like he is finished with his rehab assignment and should slot into the club\u2019s rotation next week, the issue is there is no place to put him. Do they bring him back in the bullpen or piggyback him with someone else and keep the regular five-man rotation intact? It\u2019s possible. Or they could go with a six-man rotation at least one trip through, which would cost Misiorowski his second start of the week. He\u2019s worth starting every week regardless, so there\u2019s no decision to be made on this inflection point.\\nWe\u2019re also waiting to see who the Rays slot into their rotation to replace the recently demoted Taj Bradley . The most likely candidate is Joe Boyle , who is someone fantasy managers have been hanging onto in the hopes that he finally gets the opportunity. The problem if it happens this week, is he would draw an absolutely brutal two-start week, having to take on the Yankees in the Bronx before battling the vaunted offense of the Dodgers at Steinbrenner Field. We\u2019ll update as we get more information.\\nWithout further ado, let's dig into the options for the week of July 28.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNote: Probable pitchers as of Friday, July 25, and are subject to change.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFramber Valdez , Astros, LHP (vs. Nationals, @ Red Sox)\\nThrough his first 20 starts, Valdez has functioned as a true ace for fantasy managers, posting an 11-4 record, 2.67 ERA, 1.13 WHIP and a 129/42 K/BB ratio over 128 innings. He should be started each and every week without hesitation, it\u2019s just an added bonus that he gets to double his fun this week. He represents one of the top overall options on the board this week and should continue his dominance.\\nMax Fried , Yankees, LHP (vs. Rays, @ Marlins)\\nWhile he has come back to Earth a bit after his brilliant start to the season, Fried still owns a tremendous 11-4 record, 2.62 ERA, 1.04 WHIP and 116/30 K/BB ratio over 127 1/3 innings through his first 21 starts on the season. Now he gets to battle the Rays at home before taking on a weak Marlins\u2019 offense in Miami, which seems like a recipe for success. Fantasy managers should have him locked into lineups regardless of matchups, but this week lines up particularly well for the Yankees\u2019 southpaw.\\nJacob deGrom , Rangers, RHP (@ Angels, @ Mariners)\\nJacob deGrom has managed to stay healthy through his first 20 starts on the season and in turn has delivered excellent results \u2013 going 10-2 with a minuscule 2.28 ERA, 0.90 WHIP and a 122/25 K/BB ratio over his 118 1/3 innings. As long as he continues pitching, he should be locked into fantasy lineups and this juicy two-start week is no exception.\\n\\nSlade Cecconi , Guardians, RHP (vs. Rockies, vs. Twins)\\nCecconi has quietly done a very nice job through his first 12 starts for the Guardians, compiling a 3.76 ERA, 1.23 WHIP and a 60/20 K/BB ratio across 69 1/3 innings. He draws a terrific matchup to start the week, getting to take on the Rockies at home before finishing the week with a home tilt against the Twins. He checks all of the boxes of everything that we\u2019re looking for except for the elite strikeout rate, but that is covered by the extra volume that he\u2019ll see during a two-start week. Even if rain factors in or the Guardians decide to insert a spot starter into their rotation during the week, he still winds up with a single start against the Rockies at home that you would want to use anyways. Cecconi looks like a very strong option in leagues of all sizes for the upcoming week.\\nLuis Castillo , Mariners, RHP (@ Athletics, vs. Rangers)\\nCastillo continues to march on and post quality numbers each week, posting a 3.30 ERA, 1.24 WHIP and a 107/36 K/BB ratio over 120 innings through his first 21 starts. The strikeout rate is down from where we\u2019d expect it to be based on Castillo\u2019s career, but he has still been very effective so it\u2019s a minor gripe. He\u2019s a threat to win every time that he takes the mound and he gets to battle a pair of inferior opponents within his division, which should allow him to add to that total this week. Fire him up in all formats.\\nChris Bassitt , Blue Jays, RHP (@ Orioles, vs. Royals)\\nBassitt has pitched very well for the Jays this season, going 11-4 with a 3.88 ERA, 1.30 WHIP and a 117/29 K/BB ratio over 120 2/3 innings through his first 22 outings. He\u2019s pitching for one of the hottest teams in all of baseball and should be a good bet to add to that win total during his upcoming two-start week against the Orioles and Royals. He can be deployed with confidence in all leagues.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nZach Eflin , Orioles, RHP (vs. Blue Jays, @ Cubs)\\nEflin made his triumphant return from the injured list this past week and pitched fairly well \u2013 striking out five over five innings of two-run baseball in a no-decision against the Guardians. The matchups for the upcoming week are certainly imposing, battling a red-hot Blue Jays\u2019 squad and then having to take on the Cubs at Wrigley Field. Eflin usually keeps his ratios in check though and he should approach double-digit strikeouts over his two-start week. He\u2019s worth starting in 15-teamers for sure and I\u2019d probably roll the dice in most 12-team formats as well.\\nCasey Mize , Tigers, RHP (vs. Diamondbacks, @ Phillies)\\nIf you just glanced as Mize\u2019s season-long line, you would think it\u2019s a no-brainer to throw him out there for a two-start week regardless of his matchups. I\u2019m not so sure that\u2019s the right call. He has been absolutely obliterated in each of his last two starts \u2013 one before and one after the All-Star break \u2013 giving up 10 runs on 16 hits over seven innings against the Mariners and the Pirates. He now has to take on a pair of strong offenses in the Diamondbacks and Phillies, with the second start coming on the road. In 15-teamers it\u2019s hard to get away from this as you are unlikely to have better options, but I wouldn\u2019t be throwing him with much confidence in 12-teamers after the beatings that he just endured.\\nRich Hill , Royals, LHP (vs. Braves, @ Blue Jays)\\nIs it more than just a great story that Rich Hill is back in the big leagues and making starts for the Royals as the oldest player in the league at 45-years-old? It could be. The grizzled southpaw actually looked good in his first start, allowing just one earned run over five innings against the Cubs, though he recorded only one strikeout. The matchups aren\u2019t ideal this week and he\u2019s still unlikely to deliver more than a handful of strikeouts over a two-start week, but there\u2019s some appeal to streaming Hill in deeper leagues. He\u2019s unlikely to blow up your ratios and should at least have a shot at earning a victory. You could surprisingly do a whole lot worse this week.\\nSimeon Woods Richardson , Twins, RHP (vs. Red Sox, @ Guardians)\\nThe 24-year-old right-hander has pitched much better recently, posting a 1.99 ERA, 1.15 WHIP and an 18/12 K/BB ratio over 22 2/3 innings in his last five starts. The problem has been his efficiency, as he hasn\u2019t worked deeper than five innings in any of those starts and has gone 4 2/3 and three innings his last two times out. He should provide decent ratios and a handful of strikeouts, though his chances of earning a victory are diminished with him not working deeply into games. If you\u2019re good with that, then he\u2019s worth a look in all leagues.\\nLogan Evans , Mariners, RHP (@ Athletics, vs. Rangers)\\nDespite an elevated WHIP, Evans has done a nice job through his first 11 starts for the Mariners, compiling a 3.64 ERA, 1.40 WHIP and a 43/21 K/BB ratio across 59 1/3 innings. He\u2019s in a good position to add to his win total this week with matchups against the Athletics and Rangers on tap, which makes him a worthwhile streaming option in shallower leagues in which he may still be hanging around on the waiver wire.\\nPatrick Corbin , Rangers, LHP (@ Angels, @ Mariners)\\nAt this stage of his career Corbin is who he is. Someone who can provide decent ratios, give you a shot at a victory and will pick up a couple of strikeouts every time he takes the mound. That makes him a viable option in most two-start weeks. This time he\u2019ll battle the Angels and Mariners \u2013 both on the road \u2013 where he once again makes for a decent streaming play. There\u2019s not much there in terms of ceiling, but you could do a whole lot worse than streaming Corbin for a pair of starts this week.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJP Sears , Athletics, LHP (vs. Mariners, vs. Diamondbacks)\\nSears has struggled through his first 21 starts for the Athletics this season, posting an underwhelming 4.98 ERA, 1.25 WHIP and a 91/26 K/BB ratio over 106 2/3 innings. Having to pitch twice at Sutter Health Park in West Sacramento doesn\u2019t work in his favor, nor does the fact that he\u2019ll be taking on a couple of strong opposing offenses. The strikeouts should be there given the added volume of a two-start week, but don\u2019t count on Sears for strong ratios and his chances of earning a victory aren\u2019t particularly high.\\nRichard Fitts , Red Sox, RHP (@ Twins, vs. Astros)\\nFitts has shown a bit of rust since returning from the injured list, registering a 5.06 ERA, 1.25 WHIP and a 17/3 K/BB ratio over 16 innings of work while making it through five innings just once over those four starts. The matchups are tough as well, fueling the ratio risk for the upcoming week. If all you\u2019re looking for is strikeouts, he should be able to come through for you there \u2013 and really his WHIP has been in an acceptable range for much of the season. There\u2019s just a chance that he blows up your ERA in one of these outings. Depending on your level of risk tolerance, he could be worth a look as a streaming option in deeper leagues.\\nDavis Martin , White Sox, RHP (vs. Phillies, @ Angels)\\nDepending on what you\u2019re looking for, it\u2019s possible that Martin could be a viable streaming option in deeper formats. He\u2019s not a big strikeout guy, but from the volume of two starts he could claw his way to five or six over the course of the week. He\u2019s also very unlikely to win a game while pitching for the White Sox, but even a blind squirrel finds a nut once in a while. The start against the Phillies looks like a tough matchup, but Martin has done a nice job controlling his ratios this season. There isn\u2019t much upside here, but if you\u2019re looking strictly for volume that\u2019s not going to destroy your ratios, he could be in play.\\nDrew Rasmussen , Rays, RHP (@ Yankees, vs. Dodgers)\\nThis one really depends on what it is that you\u2019re looking for. Rasmusen has been outstanding this season, there\u2019s no denying that. The issue is that the Rays are now limiting his innings and he\u2019s only likely to go three or four innings in each of these starts. If the matchups were better, I\u2019d probably recommend using him, as eight innings of quality ratios and strikeouts would be worth it in most cases, even if he doesn\u2019t earn a win. The problem is that the matchups couldn\u2019t be worse. I don\u2019t think the risk justifies what little upside there is here at the moment. I would sit him if possible in all leagues.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNational League\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMatthew Boyd , Cubs, LHP (@ Brewers, vs. Orioles)\\nMatthew Boyd has been able to avoid the injured list and is putting together a magical campaign in his age-34 season for the Cubs. He holds an 11-3 record, 2.20 ERA, 1.01 WHIP and a 108/24 K/BB ratio across 118 2/3 innings of work over his first 20 starts. He starts the upcoming week with a tough matchup against the Brewers in a critical divisional battle before finishing up with the Orioles at home. He should continue to be treated like a true ace for fantasy purposes, meaning we\u2019re starting him every week without question regardless of the matchups.\\nCristopher S\u00e1nchez , Phillies, LHP (@ White Sox, vs. Tigers)\\nWhile he was snubbed from making his second straight National League All-Star team, S\u00e1nchez has certainly been worthy \u2013 going 9-2 with a 2.40 ERA, 1.09 WHIP and a 134/32 K/BB ratio over 124 innings. He really gets to feast this week, as he\u2019ll battle a hapless White Sox\u2019 offense in Chicago before taking on a struggling Tigers\u2019 offense that has been particularly brutal against left-handed pitching over the last couple of weeks. He should be locked into 100 percent of lineups and represents one of the top overall plays of the week.\\n\\nEdward Cabrera , Marlins, RHP (@ Cardinals, vs. Yankees)\\nThe 27-year-old right-hander has impressed through his first 17 starts with the Marlins this season, posting a 3.48 ERA, 1.24 WHIP and a 92/30 K/BB ratio over 88 innings. He has struck out five or more batters in each of his last 11 starts and has allowed more than two earned runs just twice during that impressive stretch. The matchup against the Yankees is tough, but with the way that Cabrera is throwing the ball at the moment, he should be started in all leagues for this upcoming two-start week.\\nLanden Roupp , Giants, RHP (vs. Pirates, @ Mets)\\nAside from one brutal start against the Dodgers in Los Angeles in mid-June, Roupp has done nothing but dominate since the start of May \u2013 allowing two earned runs or fewer 12 times in his last 14 starts. The walks are a problem, which leads to an elevated WHIP (1.43), but he has been a major asset for fantasy purposes aside from that. He gets a strong matchup against the Pirates to start the week where he\u2019ll be a favorite to earn a victory before finishing things up against the Mets in New York. He can be deployed with confidence in leagues of all sizes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEduardo Rodriguez , Diamondbacks, LHP (@ Tigers, @ Athletics)\\nIt\u2019s been a disappointing season overall for the 32-year-old southpaw, compiling a 5.50 ERA, 1.65 WHIP and a 93/32 K/BB ratio over 86 2/3 innings in his 17 starts. Aside from one disaster against the Royals though, he has actually been decent since the calendar flipped to June \u2013 posting a 3.86 ERA, 1.59 WHIP and a 41/14 K/BB ratio over 42 innings. He also gets the added benefit of facing the Tigers when they\u2019re slumping and can\u2019t score runs to save their lives. The strikeouts should certainly be there over two starts on the week and his chances of earning a victory are elevated this week, making him a decent streaming option in shallow formats where he may still be available.\\nFrankie Montas , Mets, RHP (@ Padres, vs. Giants)\\nDespite his horrific struggles while rehabbing in the minor leagues, Frankie Montas has done a decent job since joining the Mets\u2019 rotation. He has compiled a 4.62 ERA, 1.30 WHIP and a 23/6 K/BB ratio over 25 1/3 innings in his first five starts. He has allowed just three runs over 10 2/3 innings over his last two starts while racking up 11 strikeouts, showing that he\u2019s getting better as he continues to shake off the rust. The matchups are middle of the road, but nothing to shy away from, so I\u2019d be comfortable starting Montas in leagues of all sizes for this upcoming two-start week.\\nMitch Keller , Pirates, RHP (@ Giants, @ Rockies)\\nAssuming that he remains with the Pirates through the trade deadline, Mitch Keller lines up for a very strong two-start week next week. He\u2019ll take on the Giants in an extreme pitcher\u2019s park in San Francisco before traveling to Coors Field to battle a Rockies\u2019 team that has struggled regardless of where they are playing. He\u2019s a strong bet to deliver quality ratios whenever he takes the mound, the downside with Keller has been his limited strikeouts and his poor win equity pitching for the Pirates. Both of those issues are muted this week with him making two starts \u2013 and one of them coming against the Rockies. I\u2019d feel good throwing him out there in leagues of all sizes.\\nDylan Cease , Padres, RHP (vs. Mets, vs. Cardinals)\\nCease has been a bit of an enigma this season. He\u2019s got a poor ERA (4.59) which comes from a few brutal outings in which he gets knocked around, but then he\u2019ll go out and dominate over his next couple of starts without rhyme or reason. We know what he\u2019s never going to be a major asset in WHIP, but regardless of his performance he has been a monster in the strikeout department. He should easily eclipse double digit strikeouts during his upcoming two-start week and pitching for the Padres he has a good shot at earning a victory every time he takes the mound. Fantasy managers surely understand what they\u2019re getting from Cease by now and as long as you can stand the potential hit in ERA, he should be started in all leagues.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChase Burns , Reds, RHP (vs. Dodgers, vs. Braves)\\nThe 22-year-old rookie right-hander has been knocked around in his first five starts at the big league level \u2013 posting a 6.65 ERA and 1.62 WHIP over 21 2/3 innings. The one thing that he has been able to do though, is pile up strikeouts with 35 through his first five starts. It\u2019s not going to get any easier for him this week, as he\u2019ll have to take on the Dodgers in the bandbox known as Great American Ballpark before taking on the Braves in the MLB Speedway Classic in Bristol, Tennessee. If all you care about his strikeouts and can handle the ratio risk, then by all means take a shot on Burns this week. Otherwise, you may want to steer clear.\\nBradley Blalock , Rockies, RHP (@ Guardians, vs. Pirates)\\nIt\u2019s easy to say that we should avoid all Rockies\u2019 starting pitchers for their two-start weeks and in practice it makes a lot of sense. I\u2019d love to be able to find a reason to recommend an intriguing young right-hander with matchups on tap against the Guardians on the road and the light-hitting Pirates at Coors Field, but Blalock has struggled to a miserable 8.67 ERA and 1.78 WHIP over 27 innings so far this season while recording a pitiful total of only nine strikeouts. He should be avoided in all leagues.\\nAndre Pallante , Cardinals, RHP (vs. Marlins, @ Padres)\\nPallante is the type of arm that always seems to be available if you\u2019re willing to roll the dice for his two-start weeks. He has been very unimpressive this season, with a 4.91 ERA, 1.37 WHIP and just 72 strikeouts over 110 innings on the year. He\u2019s probably not going to be an asset in ratios this week. What you\u2019re gambling on, is whether or not you think he can beat the Marlins. If he does, he\u2019ll probably deliver favorable results for the week. If not, he\u2019ll end up hurting your squad. Once again, it all depends on your level of risk tolerance.\\nBrad Lord , Nationals, RHP (@ Astros, vs. Brewers)\\nLord has done a decent job bouncing back and forth between the Nationals\u2019 bullpen and their starting rotation, but that doesn\u2019t mean we should be firing him for a difficult two-start week against the Astros and Brewers. He\u2019s still in the process of getting stretched back out and only threw 50 pitches over four innings his last time out. The upside doesn\u2019t justify the risk here.\\n        Published: Fri, 25 Jul 2025 18:22:26 +0000\\n        Source: NBC Sports\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Some things to be excited about as Yankees take on Phillies\\n        Description: Aaron Nola is making rehab progress with a bullpen session and Bryson Stott had quite an exciting day when he and his wife welcomed their newborn son.\\n        Link: https://www.nbcsportsphiladelphia.com/mlb/philadelphia-phillies/phillies-notes-new-york-yankees-vs-philadelphia-phillies-aaron-nola-bryson-stott/676555/?partner=yahoo\\n        Content: Some things to be excited about as Yankees take on Phillies originally appeared on NBC Sports Philadelphia\\nNEW YORK \u2013 We have all become accustomed to the monotone approach Phillies manager Rob Thomson takes when talking about his team. Try to figure out whether his team won a great game or lost an excruciating one, his demeanor certainly won\u2019t be a hint as to which it was.\\nWhen the subject of pitcher Aaron Nola and his current rehabilitation comes up, however, there is a bit \u2013 just a bit \u2013 of excitement that seems to invade the inflection of his voice. Friday before the Phillies took on the New York Yankees, Nola pitched a bullpen session that, by all accounts, have him right where the team wants him to be as he makes his way back from a right ankle sprain and a stress fracture in his right rib cage that has had him sidelined since May 14.\\n\u201cGreat,\u201d Thomson said of Nola\u2019s session at Yankee Stadium. \u201cThree ups, 56 pitches and his command was excellent. To me it looks like he\u2019s ready for an assignment.\u201d\\nThough the rotation seems a bit crowded with the possibility of Mick Abel coming back up and after Andrew Painter threw a very good game Thursday at Lehigh Valley where he allowed just one hit and two earned runs in six innings. But Thomson is quick to point out that Nola could be a huge benefit going down the stretch.\\n\u201cWhen he\u2019s on he\u2019s one of the best pitchers in the game. That\u2019s what you want,\u201d Thomson said.\\n\u201cNo pain in the ankle or rib,\u201d Nola said. \u201cEverything felt normal and I think I\u2019m ready to go out and pitch at Lehigh in game situation.\\nI\u2019m trying to sharpen the delivery still and keep that sharp and keep my pitches sharp, focus on the command on all of them. First inning felt so-so today and once I started throwing more and got stretched, I felt a lot better.\\n\u201cI want to get back for sure,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s tough not pitching. It\u2019s been a little while. It\u2019s what I\u2019m used to doing and going out there every five days and taking the ball for this team. Not being able to do it for this long has been tough. But I\u2019ve learned some things during this rehab process . I\u2019ve tried to educate myself as much as I can on the injuries I\u2019ve had. I\u2019m trying to keep my body strong from here on out. I\u2019m excited to go to Lehigh and pitch a couple games and finally get in game situations.\u201d\\nThomson wasn\u2019t sure if Nola will throw another bullpen before pitching for Lehigh. No matter, the plan is pretty laid out. \u201cI\u2019d like to see him get to at least 90 pitches,\u201d Thomson said. \u201cSo the first time out will probably be the same as it was today, 55 to 60 pitches. And then we\u2019ll graduate him 15 pitches per outing to get him to 90. Whatever that math is.\u201d\\nDaddy done good\\nWith barely any sleep, an addition to the family (newborn son) and long batting slump hanging on his shoulders, second baseman Bryson Stott had a lot going on Wednesday when the team took on the Boston Red Sox.\\nHe responded, in a big way, by going 2-for-4 with a double and a home run. He also scored a pair. While daddy power was a subject with Stott, there are also some more technical things going on with his swing that may be turning his slump around.\\n\u201cWe had him so early and all the tests and everything we\u2019re done, like, by 8, 8:30. We were kind of just sitting around,\u201d said Stott of the birth of his second child. \u201cMy daughter was home with my mom and sister. She said \u2018we\u2019re just going to be sitting here so maybe you should go. I\u2019ll be fine.\u2019 I said \u2018are you sure?\u2019 It was all good. Had the baby around 3:40ish, probably was up till around five or so and got up around eight. I took some naps throughout the day. Felt good, good enough to go. A lot of new adrenaline with a new baby. The tiredness didn\u2019t really hit me till the off day.\\n\u201cLooking back at 2023 and the beginning of 2024, just kind of where my hands were. Trying to get back to, kind of that feeling. I think just the majority of it is timing. I was super early or super late and when you\u2019re too early you fly out to left and when you\u2019re too late you might ground out to short or line out. Just trying to find that balance of just being on time. That fixes a lot of things throughout your swing. I felt on time the last couple days.\u201d\\nStott had been just six for his last 45 heading into Wednesday. Maybe that little, loud thing in his house is just as important as where and how his hands are.\\n\u201cThe last couple of days his swings have looked a lot better,\u201d said Thomson. \u201cHe\u2019s sort of simplified the move. He knows where that barrel\u2019s at. It\u2019s a lot better. He had a lot of waggle in his hands before he made his initial move to get loaded and really was losing his barrel, didn\u2019t know where it was. Now he\u2019s just kind of sitting it on his shoulder and taking it out and it gets going and it\u2019s really simplified his swing.\u201d\\n        Published: Fri, 25 Jul 2025 18:21:43 +0000\\n        Source: NBC Sports Philadelphia\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Mets bolster bullpen with deal for Orioles lefty Gregory Soto ahead of trade deadline\\n        Description: The Mets are sending right-handed pitchers Wellington Aracena and Cameron Foster for the two-time All-Star.\\n        Link: https://www.nbcsports.com/mlb/news/mets-bolster-bullpen-with-deal-for-orioles-lefty-gregory-soto-ahead-of-trade-deadline\\n        Content: FLUSHING, N.Y. \u2014 The New York Mets have acquired help for their bullpen, trading for left-handed reliever Gregory Soto from the Baltimore Orioles for a pair of minor league pitchers.\\n\\nThe Mets announced the trade Friday. They are sending right-handed pitchers Wellington Aracena and Cameron Foster for the two-time All-Star.\\n\\nSoto, 30, has a 3.96 ERA with 18 walks and 44 strikeouts in 45 appearances for the Orioles this season. The lefty has held left-handed batters to a .138 batting average allowing just eight walks and 22 strikeouts.

A 2024 NL All-Star, he's in the fourth year of six-year, $70 million deal signed in 2022. He has a $12 million base salary this season and is due $16 million in both 2026 and 2027.\\n\\nWhile McMahon has shown pop at Coors Field, his hitting away from Colorado has been a different story. The new Yankees third baseman has a career batting average of .216 and career OPS of .665 on the road, compared to .263 and .821 at home. He has hit .146 in 41 at-bats with one home run and six RBI in his career at Yankee Stadium.\\nThe Yankees had been seeking help on the left side of their infield, with D.J. LeMahieu designated for assignment earlier this month and Oswald Peraza and Jorbit Vivas struggling to chip in. Arizona Diamondbacks slugger Eugenio Suarez had been rumored as an option, but the two teams were reportedly unable to get close to a deal, according to Jon Heyman.\\nThe Yankees are 56-46 and sit 4.5 games behind the Toronto Blue Jays for first place in the AL East. They've come out of the All-Star break struggling, with a 3-3 record, having just lost two of three to the Blue Jays. They begin a seven-game homestand Friday against the Philadelphia Phillies.\\n\\nFor the Yankees, this is an absolute no-brainer, as predictable as a deadline deal can be. The hot corner has been an abyss of woe in the Bronx for a while now; McMahon fills that need. He\u2019s no superstar, but that\u2019s fine; the Yanks just needed a capable humanoid at third. It\u2019s a glove-over-bat profile because while McMahon makes a ton of hard contact, he\u2019s immensely whiff- and strikeout-prone. Perhaps that changes now that he\u2019s free of Coors Field and all its wonkiness.\\nFor the Rockies, this qualifies as a shocker. Despite the franchise\u2019s sustained run of non-competitiveness, they\u2019ve been incredibly averse to trading away players they view as cornerstones. For other teams, completing trades of any kind with the purple mystery in the mountains is considered quite a chore. Perhaps this trade is a sign that Colorado, jolted awake by its historically bad 2025, is pivoting from those isolationist ways. Perhaps they just really liked Herring and Grosz. \u2014 Mintz\\n        Published: Fri, 25 Jul 2025 17:51:16 +0000\\n        Source: Yahoo Sports\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Yankees acquire 3B Ryan McMahon in trade with Rockies\\n        Description: The Yankees are making an upgrade at third base, acquiring Ryan McMahon from the Colorado Rockies.\\n        Link: https://sny.tv/articles/yankees-ryan-mcmahon-trade-rockies-7-25-25\\n        Content: The Yankees are making an upgrade at third base, acquiring Ryan McMahon from the Colorado Rockies.\\nNew York is sending two pitching prospects in exchange for the 2024 All-Star, LHP Griffin Herring and RHP Josh Grosz . MLB.com's Mark Feinsand was the first to report the trade.\\nThe Rockies are currently a league-worst 26-76 and on pace for the worst record in major league history.\\nMcMahon is in the fourth year of a six-year, $70 million contract. He's owed $16 million each of the next two seasons before becoming a free agent ahead of the 2028 season.\\nThe 30-year-old is slashing .217/.314/.403 this season with 16 home runs, 15 doubles, and 35 RBI over 100 games. He's struck out a league-leading 127 times, but is still on pace for his fifth straight 20-plus home run season, and the sixth of his career.\\nIt's a drop-off from his All-Star 2024 season in which he hit .242 with 20 homers, 28 doubles, and 65 RBI. McMahon had a career-best 4.0 WAR in 2021 with 23 home runs, 32 doubles, and 86 RBI in 151 games.\\n\\\"Really excited,\\\" manager Aaron Boone said pregame. \\\"Been an All-Star third baseman, really good defender. Has had some ups and downs offensively this year, I know over the last month he's been swinging the bat well. He's a presence and can really defend over there at third, and has for a number of years. We're excited to get him.\\\"\\nHe later added: \\\"I know there's real offensive potential there... The handful of times that we've played against them that I watch him, you're like, 'That's what it should look like over there.' He moves really well and has that prototypical good third base thing.\\\"\\nMcMahon was drafted by Colorado in the second round of the 2013 MLB Draft out of Mater Dei HS in Santa Ana, CA and made his debut at age 22 in 2017. Over nine seasons and 1,010 games with the Rockies, McMahon owns a .240 batting average and .743 OPS with 140 homers and 452 RBI.\\nDefensively, McMahon has logged 696 games at third base, owning a .968 fielding percentage. He's also played 244 games at second base, 70 at first base, seven as a DH, and two at SS. He's played 100 games at third this season (.978 fielding percentage) and manned the hot corner for 152 games in 2024, leading the league in both assists (323) and errors (15).\\nThe Yankees will bank on his glove at third base for at least the rest of the season, allowing them to slide Jazz Chisholm Jr. back over to second base full-time. This move also likely takes New York out of the running in the Eugenio Suarez sweepstakes. Either way, Boone believes the addition of McMahon will help the team defensively.\\n\\\"I expect, and it needs to be one of our strengths, now bringing in a McMahon and with Anthony [ Volpe ], we need them to play the way they're capable of playing and how we expect them to play. If they do, that becomes a strength. We need that to happen,\\\" Boone said.\\n\\\"I think you go around the diamond with us, I think we have a number of really good defenders, especially on most nights... Obviously, we're coming off a series where we did not play well in that regard, our last game was not good at all, probably cost us a game... There's no reason to think we can't be a really good defensive club moving forward, which I think we have been much of the year with some series mixed in where we've made mistakes.\\\"\\n        Published: Fri, 25 Jul 2025 17:50:43 +0000\\n        Source: SNY\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Mariners-D-backs kick off trade season, Spencer Jones-Yankees dilemma & Josh Luber talks sports collectibles\\n        Description: In this episode of the Baseball Bar-B-Cast, Jake Mintz and Jordan Shusterman discuss the Mariners-D-backs trade, whether now is the right time for the Yankees to trade Spencer Jones and are joined by Josh Luber to talk about sports collectibles and the upcoming collaboration between MLB and Ghostwrite.\\n        Link: https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/mariners-d-backs-kick-off-trade-season-spencer-jones-yankees-dilemma--josh-luber-talks-sports-collectibles-175003475.html\\n        Content: We\u2019re officially less than one week away from the July 31st Major League Baseball trade deadline and some teams are already making moves.

Marsh, playing left, was jogging forward. Sosa, playing third base, was backpedaling. They both were going for the Jazz Chisholm Jr. pop-up in shallow left field.\\nMarsh's right elbow appeared to drill Sosa in the back as Sosa made the putout. Sosa held onto the ball long enough to secure the catch before dropping it to the ground, rolling over and grabbing at his back.\\nMarsh, on the other hand, came out of the collision OK. Sosa was down for a couple minutes while receiving attention from trainers. He eventually walked off the field and received a hug from a remorseful Marsh. Sosa patted Marsh on the back of the head.\\nSosa officially left the game with a back contusion, but he told reporters postgame that he's feeling better and is good to go for Sunday's series finale.\\nEdmundo Sosa left the game after colliding with Brandon Marsh while catching a pop fly pic.twitter.com/uzey9Lwigs\\nSosa's scare was hardly the injury headliner, though. Yankees superstar right fielder Aaron Judge missed the game with what was ultimately diagnosed as a flexor strain in his right elbow . Fortunately for Judge, the two-time AL MVP isn't dealing with a UCL tear and is expected to have a short stay on the IL.\\nThe Phillies were without their starting right fielder, too. Nick Castellanos sat out with a left knee injury that he suffered Friday while running toward the right field wall to make the final out of a 12-5, series-opening win over the Yankees. Castellanos' injury doesn't appear to be serious, as Phillies manager Rob Thompson said before the game that they'll check back on the veteran's knee for Sunday.\\nBefore Sosa exited, he deposited a two-run home run in the top of the seventh inning. The versatile 29-year-old launched a 424-foot no-doubter to center field. The night before, he helped the Phillies polish off another decisive win over the Yankees with an RBI single that ignited a four-run ninth inning.\\nEdmundo Sosa mashes this ball to put the @Phillies up big in the 7th \ud83d\ude24 pic.twitter.com/IaLxXnaNRe\\nSosa's homer Saturday was the Phillies' second big fly of the afternoon. Bryce Harper blasted a 425-foot solo shot in the third inning. Harper's smack to right center was part of Philadelphia's climb to a 4-0 lead through four frames. Then the Phillies distanced themselves in the seventh.\\nFollowing Sosa's dinger, New York committed its 10th error in the past five games, this one resulting from a Chisholm bobble on a potential inning-ending, double-play grounder. Then surging slugger Kyle Schwarber drove home two runs with a double to center field. Schwarber now has five extra-base hits \u2014 including four home runs \u2014 and 10 RBI in his last four games.\\n\\nThe Yankees faced a 9-1 deficit, having allowed at least seven runs for the fifth time in their eight games since the All-Star break. They scattered three runs of their own in the seventh and eighth innings, two from a Giancarlo Stanton long ball, but a massive comeback wasn't in the cards.\\nPhillies starter Ranger Su\u00e1rez improved to 8-4 after allowing just one run in 5 2/3 innings while striking out eight batters while issuing only one walk and throwing a season-high 108 pitches.\\nBut the bats were the star of the show for the Phillies, who have recorded double-digit hits three games in a row. Luckily for Sosa, the one he took to his back doesn't appear as consequential as his two-run homer in the seventh.\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 21:56:24 +0000\\n        Source: Yahoo Sports\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Yankees captain Aaron Judge to go on injured list with flexor strain but no damage to UCL in elbow\\n        Description: New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge will go on the injured list with a flexor strain in his right elbow, but a scan showed no damage to the ulnar collateral ligament of the two-time AL MVP.\\n        Link: https://www.nbcsports.com/mlb/news/yankees-captain-aaron-judge-to-go-on-injured-list-with-flexor-strain-but-no-damage-to-ucl-in-elbow\\n        Content: NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Yankees captain Aaron Judge will go on the injured list with a flexor strain in his right elbow, but a scan showed no damage to the ulnar collateral ligament of the two-time AL MVP.\\nManager Aaron Boone said Judge will have 10 days to two weeks of no throwing and will be the designated hitter at first when he returns.

The good news is that the UCL is intact, meaning there is no tear in the ligament.\\n\\\"Overall, we got some good news. It is going to require an IL stint with the thought it\u2019s right about that 10 days and those few days coming off, probably in DH mode and then starting throwing in around then,\\\" Boone explained after Saturday's game. \\\"And then hopefully, get back to the outfield shortly thereafter\u2026as long as the symptoms are what they need to be.\\\"\\nJudge has already taken a PRP injection and will sit for a few days and then start swinging the bat again and see where they are at when they get to the 10-day mark. Boone is optimistic Judge could return in the minimum 10 days.\\nThe Yankees skipper has already spoken with Giancarlo Stanton on potentially getting work in the outfield to see if he's an option when Judge returns. This week is when they'll start working that into Stanton's routine, but there's nothing imminent.\\nJudge was missing from Saturday's lineup and Boone said that the Yankees Captain had felt something in his elbow on a throw during the previous series against the Blue Jays in Toronto. After starting as DH on Wednesday and the off day on Thursday, New York felt as though Judge was fine, but the injury popped up again in Friday's loss.\\n\\\"Just last night (he) was really dealing with it,\\\" Boone said prior to Saturday's game. \\\"He couldn\u2019t really throw well from the outfield.\\\"\\nJudge spoke to the media after the results came in and said that he felt something off in his elbow on a throw home, a play prior to the one he winced on. He's never had an elbow injury before and even tried to convince the team to let him avoid an IL stint so he can still bat. But the organization advised against it. Boone said that they didn't want to risk Judge injuring himself further by hitting and wanted to take care of the strain immediately.\\n\\\"Throwing is the main concern. Hitting, it happens too quick and it\u2019s not the motion where I haven\u2019t felt anything,\\\" Judge explained. \\\"The muscle that\u2019s hurt is the muscle that\u2019s used to grip. There might be some issue with that, but I\u2019ve been hitting with it the last couple of days. If I can hit, I can be out there.\\\"\\nAs for who will take Judge's spot on the roster, the Yankees have a few outfield options in Triple-A. Everson Pereira and Bryan De La Cruz are likely options as they are both right-handed, and then there's prospect Spencer Jones , who has been tearing the cover off the ball with Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. However, Jones missed Friday's game with back spasms.\\nDespite that, it's unlikely the Yankees will call up Jones, as he's not on the 40-man roster and this would be a temporary stint that won't come with enough at-bats to justify the move.\\nJudge was asked about whether the team can withstand his absence and the AL MVP front-runner said he believes in his teammates.\\n\\\"Guys are going to step up, that\u2019s what it comes down to,\\\" Judge said. \\\"I always go back to that 2019 team where I felt everyone got banged up and everyone stepped up and played bigger roles than what they signed up for coming into the season.

Despite nine hits and five walks, the Yanks scored just four runs. They went 1-for-10 with RISP and left 11 men on base.\\n-Meanwhile, Marcus Stroman put his team behind the eight ball early, allowing a run in the first inning to put New York in an early hole. The right-hander did not have a successful outing and only managed to go 3.2 innings.\\nIt was in that fourth inning when things really spiraled for Stroman. Down 2-0 at that point, Stroman walked the leadoff hitter -- one of four walks in the inning -- before a single and another walk loaded the bases. The third walk of the inning forced in a run and Trea Turner 's force out brought home another. After a wild pitch and another walk loaded the bases once again, Stroman's day was done.\\nYerry De los Santos came in and threw one pitch and got Bryce Harper to ground out to end the inning and save Stroman from further disaster. In all, Stroman allowed four runs on five hits and four walks while striking out four on 89 pitches (50 strikes). He also allowed a home run to Harper in the third and his ERA rose to 6.09 through eight starts.\\n-The Yankees got a run back in the bottom of the fourth thanks to Jasson Dominguez 's RBI single, but with runners on the corners and two outs, Trent Grisham grounded out to end the threat.\\n-After scoring a run in the sixth, which was charged to De los Santos, Philadelphia went into the seventh inning up 5-1, where Allan Winans took the ball. In just his third appearance of the season and first since June 28, Winans wore it on the chin. He allowed four runs (three earned) in the seventh after Edmundo Sosa blasted a two-run shot and Kyle Schwarber hit a two-run double.\\nWinans went back out for the eighth and managed to strand a runner on second base (leadoff double) with two strikeouts and a groundout before pitching a clean ninth inning.\\n- Giancarlo Stanton 's two-run homer in the seventh cut the deficit to 9-3. It was Stanton's seventh home run of the season. He also singled in the ninth and ended his day 2-for-5.\\n-New York scored another run in the eighth on a bases-loaded balk. With runners on second and third, Paul Goldschmidt had a chance to make things interesting but struck out. He finished 0-for-4 with a walk.\\n- Ryan McMahon made his team debut after getting traded from the Colorado Rockies on Friday and finished 1-for-3 with a walk and two strikeouts in the No. 8 spot in the lineup.\\nThe lefty struck out eight over 5.2 innings to grab his eighth win of the season.\\nThe Yankees conclude their weekend series against the Phillies with a Sunday matinee starting at 1:35 p.m.\\nLHP Carlos Rod\u00f3n (10-7, 3.10 ERA) takes on RHP Zack Wheeler (9-3, 2.39 ERA).\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 20:29:13 +0000\\n        Source: SNY\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Phillies\u2019 Edmundo Sosa leaves with bruised back after collision with teammate Brandon Marsh\\n        Description: Philadelphia third baseman Edmundo Sosa left Saturday\u2019s game against the New York Yankees after he was elbowed in the back by left fielder Brandon Marsh in a collision while catching Jazz Chisholm Jr.'s seventh-inning popup.\\n        Link: https://www.nbcsports.com/mlb/news/phillies-edmundo-sosa-leaves-with-bruised-back-after-collision-with-teammate-brandon-marsh\\n        Content: Philadelphia third baseman Edmundo Sosa left Saturday\u2019s game against the New York Yankees after he was elbowed in the back by left fielder Brandon Marsh in a collision while catching Jazz Chisholm Jr.'s seventh-inning popup.\\nSosa was diagnosed with a bruise and will be evaluated further, the team said.\\nSosa, Marsh and shortstop Trea Turner converged on the ball in short left field.

The team is currently awaiting imaging results.\\nAnd while it doesn't appear to be as potentially serious, Nick Castellanos will sit out Saturday's game due to a knee injury suffered in Friday's 12-5 win over the Yankees. Castellanos jammed his left knee while running toward the right field wall to make the final out, according to Phillies manager Rob Thomson .\\n\\nThe Phillies' right fielder went 2-for-5 in the Phillies' win and is hitting .270/.311/.434 with 23 doubles, 13 home runs and 56 RBI. He's third among Philadelphia's regulars in homers and second in RBI.\\nCastellanos' knee was sore Saturday, so the Phillies decided to keep him out of the lineup. Thomson said they will check back on the knee for Sunday, but it appears this is more of a day-to-day issue compared to what the Yankees are fearing with Judge, pending his MRI results.\\nWith Castellanos out, Max Kepler (.201, .661 OPS, 11 HR) will get the start in right field. Brandon Marsh (.244, .659 OPS) will move over to left field and Johan Rojas (.232, .589) will play center on Saturday. That lack of punch without Castellanos might be a factor in what the Phillies pursue before next week's MLB trade deadline.\\n\\nAnother outfielder could help and Philadelphia has reportedly shown interest in the Cleveland Guardians' Steven Kwan (.282, .762 OPS). Calling up top outfield prospect Justin Crawford is another possibility, but Phillies president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski wants him to play every day , which he might not do on the major league roster.\\nCrawford, 21, is batting .326/.409/.430 for Triple-A Lehigh Valley. He wouldn't add power to the Phillies lineup with only three home runs, but would bring speed with 31 stolen bases.\\nPhiladelphia has also been attached to Arizona Diamondbacks slugger Eugenio Su\u00e1rez in trade rumors.

Wilson had second-most wagers (11%, behind the Royals' Jac Caglionone) and by far the most money of any player at 33%. Wilson also represented the sportsbook's biggest liability on the award.\\nBut after Friday night's offensive explosion, Kurtz became the odds-on favorite for the first time all season and now has -2000 odds to win, an implied probability of 95% to win the award.\\nIt's an astonishing baseball \u2014 and betting \u2014 story, and one we'll be sure to follow throughout the rest of the season.\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 15:59:00 +0000\\n        Source: Yahoo Sports\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Aaron Judge out of Yankees' lineup Saturday due to 'elbow issue'\\n        Description: Manager Aaron Boone said Judge was having trouble throwing the ball from the outfield Friday.\\n        Link: https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/breaking-news/article/aaron-judge-out-of-yankees-lineup-saturday-due-to-elbow-issue-150849711.html\\n        Content: Aaron Judge is not in the New York Yankees' lineup Saturday against the Philadelphia Phillies due to an \\\"elbow issue,\\\" manager Aaron Boone said.\\n\\\"He felt like he was fine on the off day [Thursday],\\\" Boone said. \\\"Last night he was really dealing with it, couldn't really throw from the outfield.\\\"\\nAccording to Boone, Judge was taken for imaging, and the team is currently awaiting the results.\\n[ Join or create a Yahoo Fantasy Football league for the 2025 NFL season ]\\nJudge was seen wincing and gripping his right hand after a throw during Tuesday night's win over the Toronto Blue Jays.

When Yankees outfielder Trent Grisham lined out to right field to end the game, Nick Castellanos wound up hitting the outfield wall in a bit of an awkward way. It cost him a start Saturday afternoon and may or may not keep him out a bit longer.\\n\u201cThe last play last night, where he went back towards the wall, he just kind of jammed his left knee,\u201d manager Rob Thomson said. \u201cHe came in a little bit sore today, so keeping him out.

The New York Post reported that Judge was to undergo an MRI before Saturday\u2019s game as well as see a team doctor. Judge leads the league with a .342 average and is tops in RBI with 85. His 129 hits are also a league best.\\nWalker, Nola updates\\nWhen asked if Taijuan Walker will stay in the rotation, Thomson didn\u2019t hesitate with his answer. \u201cYeah. Yeah, he\u2019s got it. I think the next start is the last one in Chicago.\u201d Thomson was referring to Wednesday afternoon\u2019s game against the White Sox. Walker admitted after his start on Friday that he knows and accepts the fact that he\u2019ll be heading back to the bullpen in the near future as Aaron Nola gets closer to being put back into the starting rotation. Nola had a bullpen session on Friday and now will start to see some live action.\\n\u201cHe will go out on a rehab assignment Thursday, (with Lehigh Valley)\u201d Thomson said. \u201cYeah will keep him the same (60 pitches). Three up-downs.\u201d Mick Abel struggled through five innings with the Iron Pigs Friday, allowing seven hits and five earned runs while walking three. But the manager wasn\u2019t too displeased with the results.\\n\u201cCommand was off a little bit,\u201d Thomson said. \u201cIn the notes the good thing is they mentioned he maintained his focus, maintained his poise even though he didn\u2019t have his command and tried to fight through it. So that\u2019s a good sign. He\u2019s really grown up so it was good to see him do that last night, have some failure and just keep fighting through it.\u201d\\nBohm to rejoin on road trip\\nThird baseman Alec Bohm will join the team Sunday in New York then will fly with them to Chicago for the series against the White Sox. \u201cStill a little bit sore. Just check him out tomorrow and see how he is.\u201d Bohm was hit by a pitch from Yu Darvish back on July 12 and it was later determined he had a fractured rib. In his place, Thomson has been rotating Otto Kemp and Edmundo Sosa at third, but hinted he may have both of them in the lineup on Sunday.\\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see both of them, really. Kind of flip them back and forth and maybe get Kemp back to the outfield at some point. I\u2019m sure tomorrow we\u2019ll have Kemp at third and Sosa at second and probably Wes Wilson in the outfield.\u201d\\nThe Phillies are scheduled to face Yankees left-hander Carlos Rodon on Sunday.\\n\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 13:51:42 +0000\\n        Source: NBC Sports Philadelphia\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Shaikin: Home again?

He has saved more games than all but three men in major league history, all of them Hall of Famers. He won a World Series with the Dodgers .\\nFor all that Jansen has accomplished in his two decades in pro ball, there is one thing he has not experienced: He never has been traded.\\nThat could happen in the coming days, with baseball\u2019s trade deadline next Thursday. As we talked about that possibility Friday at Angel Stadium, and about how the sport can be a cold business at times, he dropped 11 words that stood out.\\n\u201cI thought,\u201d he said, \u201cI would play my whole career with the Dodgers.\u201d\\nMaybe you can go home again.\\nRead more: With trade deadline looming, Dodgers showcase revived offense in win over Boston\\nThe Dodgers are urgently shopping for right-handed relievers. In Anaheim, Jansen is enjoying a season that by some measures is his best since 2021, his last season with the Dodgers .\\nFirst things first: Jansen did not sign with the Angels just to rack up saves. He is 36 saves shy of 500, a milestone reached only by Mariano Rivera and Trevor Hoffman.\\n\u201cI came here with one goal in mind,\u201d Jansen said, \u201cand the goal was to help this team turn around, to end that playoff drought. That\u2019s what I\u2019m here for.\\n\u201cIf they move me, I\u2019d definitely feel disappointed we didn\u2019t accomplish it.\u201d\\nBut let\u2019s be real: The longest playoff drought in the majors is likely to hit 11 years. The Angels are 4\u00bd games out of a postseason berth, but they would have to pass six teams to sneak into the last wild-card spot in the American League playoffs. Baseball Prospectus projects their chance of making the playoffs at 2%.\\nThe Angels demoted their fifth starter this month. They have been running bullpen games because they had no one in their farm system ready to fill the vacancy. They only have two starters you could pencil into their 2026 rotation.\\nThey need pitching depth, and it would be organizational malpractice not to get some by trading their pending free agents, Jansen included.\\nFor the Angels, the optimal outcome would be a team desperate for a closer overpaying to get Jansen.\\nHowever, such a team would be more likely to overpay for the marquee names on the market, including Jhoan Duran of the Minnesota Twins, Emmanuel Clase of the Cleveland Guardians and Felix Bautista of the Baltimore Orioles, with a second tier led by David Bednar of the Pittsburgh Pirates and Ryan Helsley of the St. Louis Cardinals.\\nThe Dodgers hate to overpay.\\nJansen has 17 saves and one blown save, with a 1.00 earned-run average in save situations and a 3.19 ERA overall. The latter is his lowest ERA since 2021. By ERA+, a statistic that accounts for league and ballpark factors, Jansen is at 133 \u2014 or 33% better than league average.\\nThe only Dodgers relievers with an ERA+ above 133: left-handers Alex Vesia and Jack Dreyer .\\nDodgers relievers have thrown 49.1% of the team\u2019s innings pitched; the highest percentage of any major league team. Vesia, Anthony Banda and the injured Tanner Scott rank among the top 20 in appearances. Ben Casparius , who earned his first major league save Friday , ranked second among major league relievers in innings pitched.\\nIn an ideal world, the Dodgers would enter the playoffs with four primary right-handed relievers: Blake Treinen , Michael Kopech , Brusdar Graterol and Evan Phillips .\\nPhillips is out for the season. Treinen could return from the injured list next week, with Kopech possibly to follow next month and Graterol in September, but it is risky to count on injured players to return healthy and effective.\\nIn a major league career that started in 2010, Jansen never has been on the injured list because of an elbow or forearm issue, and his two stints for shoulder inflammation were brief.\\nThe Dodgers could drop Jansen into their mix of high-leverage right-handers. They would not want Jansen if he would want to be the unquestioned closer.\\nHe is getting the job done as a closer, and he is getting closer to 500 saves. But the Dodgers' analysts would probably take note of his career highs in exit velocity and hard-hit balls, and a .774 OPS against left-handers that compares unfavorably to his .600 career mark, and might want to spot him against a run of right-handers. Could be the sixth inning, could be the ninth.\\nRead more: Beyond the bullpen, how aggressive will the Dodgers be at the MLB trade deadline?\\nWhether it\u2019s the Dodgers or any other contending team, would Jansen consider a role outside the ninth inning?\\n\u201cAt that point, it\u2019s just about getting rings,\u201d Jansen said. \u201cMy goal is to win. You play for that, always. I understand there is a milestone I am close to. But, at the end of the day, it\u2019s what you play for. You play to win. You play to win a World Series.\\n\u201cIf I have to go throw the sixth, seventh, eighth, I would do it. I\u2019m a professional. I would do what I do best, and that is pitch.\u201d\\nJansen said he hasn\u2019t given up on this Angels team, or this Angels season. He would love to win in Anaheim. The Angels could help him do that: Trade him for another pitching piece that could help them next year, then sign Jansen again over the winter.\\nSign up for more Dodgers news with Dodgers Dugout.

They're just really good at all aspects of the game.\\\"\\nAnd in the off-season their roster got even better. After their starting pitcher rotation was hit by injuries last year, they brought in Blake Snell and Roki Sasaki to add greater strength in depth.\\nThey also re-signed veteran pitcher Clayton Kershaw and knew that at some point Shohei Ohtani would be able to pitch again after recovering from elbow surgery.\\nOhtani is a 'unicorn' in that he is a two-way player. The Japanese star is the first MLB player to be elite at both pitching and hitting at the same time.\\nAfter joining the Dodgers in a deal worth $700m (\u00a3558m), he could only hit in his first season, yet still earned his third Most Valuable Player award as they won the World Series.\\nThe Dodgers' offensive line-up also features two former MVPs in Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman, who are part of a nucleus of players on long-term contracts.\\nAnd the team bolstered that core with Tommy Edman and Teoscar Hernandez signing extensions.\\nIt's a good job the Dodgers secured that pitching insurance for this season because their injury woes returned, with four of their starting pitchers having had spells out.\\nThat has meant they could not sustain that early-season form and have had to use their relieving pitchers - known as the bullpen - far more than any other MLB team.\\nThat has taken its toll, with six relieving pitchers currently out injured, and the team generally struggling for form - in the outfield, on the mound and at the plate.\\nBetts has hit three home runs in his past 49 games and Freeman one in 61.\\nAt the start of this month, the Dodgers lost seven games in a row for the first time since September 2017. And since that 8-0 start to the season, their record is 53-43.\\nManager Dave Roberts said on Tuesday: \\\"It better be rock bottom, as far as how we've been pitching, how we've been playing defence.\\n\\\"I think the offence is kind of starting to tick up, which is good. There's certainly more in there. But I think as far as quality of baseball, it's been a tough watch. It really has.\\\"\\nOhtani's class continues to shine through though. Only Seattle's Cal Raleigh (39) has hit more home runs than Ohtani (37) this season.\\nOhtani homered in five consecutive games over the past week, and in one of those games he also had three strikeouts as a pitcher.\\nThe 31-year-old's return to the mound last month has provided the Dodgers with some relief.\\nSo far he has made six starts, with his innings gradually being increased, and in his third game back, Ohtani threw his fastest MLB pitch ever (101.7mph).\\nOhtani is not scheduled to pitch again until Wednesday, with Dustin May set to be the Dodgers' starting pitcher for Sunday's game against Boston.\\nAnd there will be a familiar face on the Fenway Park mound.\\nWalker Buehler left the Dodgers for the Red Sox in the off-season and before the start of their three-game series on Friday, some of his former team-mates presented Buehler with his World Series ring for last season's championship triumph.\\nThe Dodgers won Friday's game 5-2 to improve their record to 61-43 atop the National League West division.\\nBoston are 55-50 and sit third in the American League East, with Wilyer Abreu (20 home runs) their leading hitter.\\nAfter going into the All-Star break on a 10-game winning streak, the Red Sox have won just two of their seven games since.\\nAs it stands, they would end their three-year play-off absence, but they too need an upturn in form to be sure of securing a wild-card spot.\\nBBC Sport will be showing an MLB game live every Sunday evening until the end of the regular season on 28 September.\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 08:43:03 +0000\\n        Source: BBC\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Mets' Francisco Lindor says swing is in a 'good spot' after collecting three hits in win over Giants\\n        Description: Mets shortstop Francisco Lindor continued where he left off with a three-hit performance against the Giants on Friday night and said his swing is feeling right.\\n        Link: https://sny.tv/articles/mets-francisco-lindor-swing-offense-better-giants\\n        Content: It wasn't long ago when Francisco Lindor was in the worst funk of his career, but the Mets shortstop has turned things around at the right time.\\nAfter breaking his career-worst 0-for-31 skid in the team's series finale against the Angels on Wednesday, Lindor picked up where he left off in Friday's impressive 8-1 win over the Giants .\\nLindor went 3-for-5, but as skipper Carlos Mendoza put it after the game, it's how his at-bats look that is encouraging to him.\\n\\\"His ability to use the whole field, and going the other way, that\u2019s when he\u2019s at his best,\\\" Mendoza said. \\\"Some really good signs and it\u2019s good to have him feeling that way.\\\"\\nMendoza broke down Lindor's three hits and said there was something to like about each of them. His first hit was a single up the middle in the first inning. The second was when he pulled an inside fastball over the right field wall for his 20th home run of the season. And even though he struck out the next two times, his final at-bat in the ninth saw Lindor go the other way for a ground-rule double down the left field line.\\n\\\"I got rhythm. I feel good,\\\" Lindor said of his swing of late. \\\"I did what I wanted to do today. Had a game plan and was able to execute it. That means my swing is in a good spot. Stay the course, continue to be better every day.\\\"\\nIt's been a rough few months for Lindor, who was hitting .283 entering June and was looking every bit of the MVP-caliber player that helped the Mets get into the postseason last year. At the lowest point of his skid in July, Lindor was hitting only .245. But after his five hits in two games, he's looking like himself at the plate again.\\nLindor credits the team, and especially the hitting staff, for keeping him positive and getting him back to a good spot with his swing.\\n\\\"It was coming and going. I work, feel good, then it disappears,\\\" Lindor said of why his swing went awry. \\\"It\u2019s human nature when you go through tough times \u2026 you rely on the people around you and hope to get a hit or two.\\\"\\nLindor closed his answer with his signature smile. And there's a lot to smile about with the Mets right now. Friday's victory pushed their winning streak to five games and they are clinging to first place in the NL East over the Phillies. But if the Mets hope to win their first division title since 2015, they'll need Lindor and his swing to feel good to get there.\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 05:53:33 +0000\\n        Source: SNY\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Mets start West Coast trip with impressive, wire-to-wire win over Giants, 8-1\\n        Description: The Mets started their West Coast trip with an impressive 8-1 wire-to-wire win over the Giants in San Francisco on Friday night.\\n        Link: https://sny.tv/articles/mets-giants-takeaways-7-25-25\\n        Content: The Mets started their West Coast trip with an impressive 8-1 wire-to-wire win over the Giants in San Francisco on Friday night.\\nNew York (60-44) remains 0.5 games ahead of the Phillies, who won their game earlier in the evening , to stay atop the NL East.\\n-Against a Cy Young-caliber pitcher in Logan Webb , the Mets jumped on him early in the first. Brandon Nimmo lined a double just over the head of left fielder Heliot Ramos -- who took a bad route to the ball -- and Francisco Lindor followed with a single. Lindor stole second before Juan Soto rolled over a grounder to the right side to plate Nimmo and move Lindor to third. Pete Alonso drove in Lindor with a sac fly to give the Mets an early 2-0 lead.\\nClay Holmes wasn't much better in his half of the first, allowing a single to Ramos and a double to Rafael Devers to lead off. Willy Adames grounded out to drive in the Giants' first run. After a walk to Matt Chapman, H olmes bounced back by getting Mike Yastryzmski to fly out and Wilmer Flores to ground out to end the 33-pitch opening frame.\\n-Webb's struggles continued in the fourth as Brett Baty and Francisco Alvarez led off with back-to-back singles. Ronny Mauricio walked to load the bases for Tyrone Taylor with no outs. Taylor chopped a grounder up the middle but Adames made a nice scoop and flip to second base, but Taylor beat out the potential double play as Baty scored. After Taylor stole second, Nimmo hit an opposite-field single to drive in two and push the Mets' lead to 6-1.\\nWebb would not last beyond the fourth, pitching his shortest outing of the season.\\n-Holmes did not last much longer as he struggled in the fifth. The right-hander allowed back-to-back singles to the No. 8 and 9 hitters, but Holmes got Ramos to pop up and Devers to strike out. He then got Adames to pop up to get through the fifth.\\nHolmes tied a career-high with 104 pitches (64 strikes) through his five innings. He allowed just one run on six hits, one walk while striking out two batters.\\n-The Mets' lineup wouldn't get much going against the Giants' bullpen, but it didn't matter as New York's bullpen was just as sharp with the team using three arms to get the final 12 outs of the game.\\n-Alonso went 0-for-4 with a sac fly RBI in this one, but he helped the Mets on the defensive end, saving Holmes, Lindor and Mauricio from errors with his glove.\\nLindor was struggling mightily before the series finale against the Angels, and his hot bat has traveled to the West Coast. After his single in the first inning, the Mets shortstop got around on an inside pitch from Webb and deposited it over the wall in right field for his 20th homer of the season. Lindor's last at-bat saw him drive a ground-rule double down the left field line. He finished 3-for-5.\\nThe Mets scored their final two runs in the ninth after Luisangel Acuna scored from third on a wild pitch and Soto's single drove in Lindor from third.\\n-The Mets were 3-for-3 (Nimmo, Taylor, Lindor) on stolen base attempts against Webb. Webb entered Friday's game, having only given up four stolen bases this season in his first 21 starts.\\nNimmo went 2-for-5 but his two-run single in the fourth put this game to bed.\\nBrandon Nimmo leads off the game with a double, Francisco Lindor follows with a single, and Juan Soto drives in Nimmo with an RBI groundout for the game's first run pic.twitter.com/nhL9wbYfwW\\nPete Alonso brings home Francisco Lindor with a sac fly to make it 2-0 Mets!

He\u2019s just the second player in Major League Baseball history to have four homers in a six-hit game, joining Shawn Green of the Los Angeles Dodgers on May 23, 2002 at Milwaukee, and he matched Green\u2019s MLB record with 19 total bases.\\nIt was the first six-hit game for the Athletics since Joe DeMaestri on July 8, 1955 at Detroit.\\nThe 23-year-old also had a single and a double that hit just below the yellow line over the visitor\u2019s bullpen in the fourth inning.\\nKurtz singled in the first and his two-run homer in the second put the Athletics ahead 5-0. His solo shot in the sixth made it 10-2. His third homer was his longest, a 414-foot drive into the second deck in the eighth.\\nKurtz\u2019s final homer came against outfielder Cooper Hummel, a three-run, opposite-field line drive to the Crawford boxes in left field that made it 15-2.\\nKurtz extended his hitting streak to 12 games and his 23 home runs are the most for an A\u2019s rookie since Yoenis C\u00e9spedes in 2012 and fourth most in franchise history.\\nTyler Soderstrom and Shea Langeliers also homered for the A\u2019s, who had a season high in runs.\\nJeffrey Springs (9-7) allowed two runs over six innings.

Here are all four homers and the rest of his 6-for-6 night, featuring an increasingly jubilant A's broadcast:\\nSomehow, that wasn't the end of the 22-year-old Kurtz's accomplishments, as he tied Shawn Green for the most total bases in a single game with 19.\\nHe also tied Green (and others) for modern era records with six runs scored and five extra base hits. He posted eight RBI, one more than Green's legendary game in 2002. It's not hyperbolic to call it the best offensive game in the history of baseball, all accomplished by a player who was in college at the start of the 2024 season.\\nThe punchline to all this was Kurtz's double in the fourth inning. Had it traveled perhaps two feet farther, we would be talking about the first five-homer game baseball has ever seen.\\nWe're on Nick Kurtz Cycle Watch after this RBI double \ud83d\udc40 pic.twitter.com/sPjRfqEmSU\\nKurtz did all that against the first-place Astros, with each homer off a different pitcher. They weren't exactly the staff aces, though, with starting pitcher Ryan Gusto (4.46 ERA entering Friday), relievers Nick Hernandez (9.00 in one inning), Kaleb Ort (5.40) and Cooper Hummel (position player) all feeling the damage.\\nIt was the second four-homer game of the season, following Arizona Diamondbacks third baseman Eugenio Suarez's big night on April 26 .\\nSince RBI became official in 1920, only one MLB player has had, over the course of his entire career (same game or not), a game with 4+ HR a game with 5+ XBH a game with 6+ hits a game with 6+ runs a game with 8+ RBI That one player is Nick Kurtz. He did it all tonight. pic.twitter.com/Uob1twG5uw\\nThat performance adds to what was already a breakout campaign for Kurtz, who entered Friday as the AL Rookie of the Year favorite at BetMGM and most certainly exited it that way. He has been the best hitter in baseball \u2014 not rookie, just hitter \u2014 over the past nine weeks or so and is now about to send some memorabilia to the Hall of Fame.\\n\\nIt has been only 368 days since Kurtz signed his first contract with the A's, joining the club after back-to-back All-American seasons at Wake Forest. He proceeded to dominate the minor leagues much like he did in the ACC, posting a 1.283 OPS between Single-A and Double-A in 2024, then a 1.040 OPS in Triple-A before his call-up in late April.\\nKurtz actually got off to a slow start in his major league career, slashing .208/.259/.299 with only one homer through May 19, the last day of an 0-for-21 skid. Since then, well, he's slashed .352/.427/.870 with 24 homers in 43 games. That's a 90.4-homer pace when extrapolated over 162 games.\\nYou have to go back to Joe DiMaggio to find a player with this many extra-base hits in his first 66 MLB games . He has one more than Ted Williams.\\n\\nHitters who enter the majors and dominate this much over even just half a season are breathtakingly rare. Kurtz was always seen as one of the best hitters in his draft class, with concerns about injuries and his defensive utility as a first-base only player dragging down his stock, but this is well beyond even the wildest expectations for him.\\nSince breaking that slump in May, he has been better at the plate than Aaron Judge, Shohei Ohtani, Cal Raleigh and every other MLB player you could possibly think of. It's unlikely he will continue this pace, but there are good players \u2014 great ones, even \u2014 who go their entire careers without a stretch like this.\\nSo all of that adds up to a win for the A's. They drafted a guy fourth overall and one year later have a budding superstar. Good work.\\nThe A's have become baseball's punchline over the past few years. Some teams have been worse on the field, such as the Chicago White Sox and Colorado Rockies, but those teams are at least playing at major league stadiums. The A's are a team that hasn't touched 70 wins since 2021, currently playing at a Triple-A ballpark in Sacramento, while waiting for a dubiously funded stadium in Las Vegas.\\nNone of that screams \\\"well-run team,\\\" but the interesting thing about the A's is they now have a very fun collection of young players, who could theoretically be a draw once the team reaches Nevada to open its doors.\\n\\nKurtz is the new big name, but there's also late-blooming All-Star designated hitter Brent Rooker in the middle of the lineup. Kurtz is the Rookie of the Year favorite, but he has company on the leaderboard with Jacob Wilson, the No. 6 pick of the 2023 MLB Draft who is currently hitting .312, and Denzel Clarke, a standout defender who also hit the third-longest homer in MLB this season.\\nAnd then there are guys like outfielders Tyler Soderstrom and Lawrence Butler, who have flashed promise in their first few MLB seasons.\\nPitching hasn't been a similar success for the A's, but every team would rather have a group of promising young hitters with oodles of team control than pitchers. The franchise is still a long ways away from contending for a World Series, but it is miles closer than it was last year.\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 02:58:06 +0000\\n        Source: Yahoo Sports\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Mets pitching prospect Brandon Sproat's scoreless streak ends in gutsy win for Triple-A Syracuse\\n        Description: The latest on Brandon Sproat, a top pitching prospect for the New York Mets.\\n        Link: https://sny.tv/articles/mets-brandon-sproat-scoreless-streak-ends-gutsy\\n        Content: Brandon Sproat scattered two runs on five hits while striking out three and walking two in five innings of Friday's 8-2 Triple-A Syracuse Mets win over the Kansas City Royals-affiliated Omaha Storm Chasers.\\nNew York's top pitching and overall prospect , according to SNY's Joe DeMayo , had not allowed an earned run in more than a month.\\nThe scoreless streak snapped in the top of the third inning when Michael Massey 's ground-rule double on a fly ball to center field scored Jordan Groshans and Rudy Martin .\\nSproat's stretch without an earned run spanned 25 innings, starting June 22.

Ever since, the veteran had looked glaringly off, batting below .200 over 48 games.\\nAt the end of this past week\u2019s homestand on Wednesday, however, Hern\u00e1ndez recorded his first three-hit game since April. And on Friday, he kept the momentum going, drawing a run-scoring walk with the bases loaded in the third inning before belting a two-run insurance homer in the top of the eighth.\\n\u201cObviously, a huge at-bat,\u201d manager Dave Roberts said of Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s home run, just his second in the last 27 games.\\nAndy Pages played a key role Friday, as well, continuing his own upward trajectory after a trying couple of weeks.\\nFrom June 26 to July 19, Pages saw what was once a near-.300 batting average tumble, hitting .206 over an 18-game stretch. The slide helped keep him from reaching the All-Star Game, then continued for the first two games coming out of the break \u2014 making him one of many Dodgers hitters mired in a midseason slump.\\nBut in the last four games of the team\u2019s recent homestand, Pages had two home runs and two multihit games.\\nOn Friday, Pages' recent surge continued, including a double that set up Tommy Edman (another recently slumping hitter) for the opening run in the second inning, a sacrifice fly after Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s walk in the third, and a single again after Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s big fly in the eighth.\\n\u201cI think they\u2019re just taking better at-bats,\u201d Roberts said of Hern\u00e1ndez and Pages. \u201cHaving those two guys in the middle of the order doing what they\u2019re doing makes life easier for all of us.\u201d\\nThere were other bright spots in the Dodgers\u2019 win. Will Smith went two for five to raise his National League-leading batting average to .325. Freddie Freeman had a pair of singles, recording consecutive multihit games for only the second time since early June. And while Shohei Ohtani saw his home run streak snapped at five games, he still reached base twice.\\nRead more: Beyond the bullpen, how aggressive will the Dodgers be at the MLB trade deadline?\\nTwo hitters who could be more important to the Dodgers\u2019 deadline calculus struggled, with Michael Conforto going only one for four (albeit with a sixth-inning double) and Hyeseong Kim extending his recent slump with a golden sombrero (four strikeouts).\\nBut on the whole, the offense (which combined for 10 hits, the third time that has happened in the last 10 games) did enough \u2014 backing up a five-inning, two-run start from Emmet Sheehan (a Connecticut native who attended nearby Boston College) and the first scoreless effort from the Dodgers\u2019 beleaguered bullpen since July 3, including a first career save for Ben Casparius (another Connecticut native who grew up playing high school tournaments at Fenway Park).\\n\u201cIt was pretty cool, especially to do it behind Emmet,\u201d Casparius said. \u201cWe kind of talked about that, hopefully getting into the same game.

The Mets' outfield was a subject brought up to Stearns since the centerfield platoon of Tyrone Taylor and Jeff McNeil has, while playing admirably, not produced consistently enough.\\nThere have been rumblings of a deal to address it at the deadline, but while Stearns shared he was comfortable with Taylor/McNeil the rest of the season, he was asked about Gilbert's recent play and whether he's on the team's radar for center field.\\n\\\"Drew\u2019s doing a tremendous job,\\\" Stearns said. \\\"I think to his credit, he\u2019s putting himself on the radar a little bit and deserves a lot of credit for that. Both offensively and defensively, he\u2019s taken a step forward over the next month or two.\\\"\\nStearns didn't necessarily answer the question, but gave his flowers to the 24-year-old who has turned his offensive game up with Syracuse.\\nEntering Friday, Gilbert was hitting .310 with a .990 OPS over the last 30 days, and that doesn't include the power performance he put on in Syracuse's game against Omaha.\\nGilbert went 3-for-4 with two home runs.\\n\\\"He's doing a tremendous his job.

Across 17 games in July, Gilbert is hitting .338 with six home runs while driving in 17 RBI a posting an OPS of 1.126.\\nEntering Friday, Taylor is hitting .209 with two home runs and 17 RBI to go with his .570 OPS across 91 games. McNeil, in 68 games entering Friday, is hitting better. He's averaging .251 with nine home runs and 32 RBI, but splits time between the outfield and infield.\\nWhile Jesse Winker continues to recover on the IL, Gilbert could be the left-handed bat the Mets are looking for to pair with Taylor. Stearns made it clear on Friday that upgrading the position with an external option isn't a priority.\\n\\\"I\u2019m comfortable with the setup we have right now,\\\" Stearns said of his centerfielders. \\\"Mendy is doing a great job of finding the right days for Jeff to be out there and for Tyrone to be out there.

Speaking with the media in San Francisco ahead of the team's series opener against the Giants, Stearns said talks with the Orioles had been going on for a couple of weeks and this was the time to push the deal through.\\nSoto will be the Mets' second high-leverage southpaw out of the pen -- along with the returning Brooks Raley -- and Stearns was asked whether getting that second lefty was his first priority.\\n\\\"It was important, you never know whether you\u2019ll be able to line up,\\\" Stearns said. \\\"Not sure how many lefty relievers are going to be traded this deadline. We weren\u2019t certain, but with the injuries we had from that side of the pen over the course of the season, we recognize the importance an arm from the left side can potentially have down the stretch and into October. It was something we definitely wanted to accomplish.\\\"\\nTeams aren't usually content with dealing for just one reliever at this time of the season. The Mets are likely to keep searching for more quality arms for the bullpen and Stearns is keeping the door open for more trades.\\n\\\"We\u2019re still talking. There\u2019s still the ability to upgrade our bullpen,\\\" he said. \\\"We\u2019re certainly not going to close the door on it.\\\"\\nHe later added, \\\"Wherever we can upgrade the team, we\u2019re going to try to do that. We\u2019ll continue to have discussions on the bullpen. We\u2019re not going to close the door on other aspects of the team. But as we said all along, the bullpen is the priority and probably remains that way.\\\"\\nBut what about the rotation? There have been reports that the Mets have checked in on starters like Dylan Cease and Sandy Alcantara.\\nWhile Stearns wouldn't say he's not in the market for an arm for the rotation, he made it clear that it's not high on his list of deals to make.\\n\\\"I like our starting rotation. Our current five is a very talented set of five,\\\" Stearns said. \\\"We\u2019re still in the process of building some of those guys up. And that\u2019s unusual to happen this time of the year, where you\u2019re doing that with multiple starters. That\u2019s the spot we\u2019re in right now.\u00a0Because of that, it puts a little extra burden on the bullpen\u2026But we know as we go through this over the next two months, we\u2019re going to need to ask more for more out of starters. We\u2019ll get there, we\u2019re not there quite yet.\\\"\\nCurrently, the Mets have David Peterson, Frankie Montas, Clay Holmes, Kodai Senga and Sean Manaea as the starting five. Senga and Manaea are coming off injuries and have not been built up, while Holmes, a converted reliever, has reached a workload he's never had in his career.\\nStearns and the organization are in a tricky spot, but the second-year Mets POBO believes in his starters. But offered the caveat that if there's a difference-maker available, they'll be checking.\\n\\\"I think if you\u2019re going to add to the team in general, you try to raise the ceiling of the team. That\u2019s how I look at that group,\\\" he said. \\\"Again, you don\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s going to be available and what\u2019s ultimately going to be traded. Acquiring starting pitching at this time of year is pretty difficult. I don\u2019t know how many 'raise the ceiling' type of players are going to be traded in that segment. If those guys are available, we\u2019ll be involved.\\\"\\n\\n\\nAnd what about the lineup? There's been plenty of talk regarding the Mets' pursuit of an outfield bat and whether they should. Like other aspects of the team, Stearns maintains he'll look into all opportunities to improve the team, but is comfortable and complimentary of how Jeff McNeil and Tyrone Taylor have played in center this season.\\n\\\"I\u2019m comfortable with the setup we have right now,\\\" Stearns said of his centerfielders. \\\"Mendy is doing a great job of finding the right days for Jeff to be out there and for Tyrone to be out there. It\u2019s two skill sets that complement each other, so\u00a0I\u2018m comfortable with that. Like with the rest of the team, we\u2019re going to explore areas of upgrades and that\u2019s one of them.\\\"\\nTaylor is having a tough year offensively. In 91 games entering Friday, Taylor is hitting .209 with two home runs and 17 RBI to go with his .570 OPS. McNeil, in 68 games entering Friday, is hitting better. He's averaging .251 with nine home runs and 32 RBI, but splits time between the outfield and infield.\\nWhen asked if he believes he needs to add a bat of any kind at the deadline, Stearns, again, was complimentary of how his team has played so far.\\n\\\"I don\u2019t think we need to,\\\" he said. \\\"We have the offensive players who can help us score a lot of runs and turn the lineup over. I continue to maintain we are taking good at-bats by and large, I\u2019m growing increasingly comfortable with the length of our lineup and the contributions we\u2019re getting from the bottom half of our lineup. With that said, we have to figure out a way to score more runs.

The Phillies bats provided the glory.\\nWalker gave all he had in his, somewhat unknown, pitching tank through 5.2 innings and Kyle Schwarber and J.T. Realmuto provided the needed power as the Phillies bulled their way to a 12-5 win over the Yankees. Schwarber belted two more home runs and picked up his 1,00th career hit on the first homer, which was caught by a Phillies fan. After the game, Schwarber met with the three friends and gave them each a baseball and took some pictures with them.\\n\u201cI\u2019ve said all along I don\u2019t know where we\u2019d be without him,\u201d said Rob Thomson of Schwarber. \u201cComes up with big hit after big hit after big hit. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d\\nFamously bounced from starter to reliever and back to starter throughout the season, it\u2019s pretty much anybody\u2019s guess how much the hulking right-hander is asked to give on any given outing. Well, he and Thomson certainly know, though no one knows how the outing may unwind.\\nTo that end, there was a \u201chold your breath\u201d kind of half inning for the Phillies earlier in the game, before they started bashing the ball all over the Bronx.\\nWalker loafed out of the visiting team\u2019s dugout at Yankee Stadium Friday night to take the mound for the sixth inning. In the previous five innings, he had only thrown 65 pitches and allowed a pair of solo home runs. It was an outing you had to be more than pleased with up to that point. As Walker strolled (he doesn\u2019t exactly use up much energy when there\u2019s no need and added to that a sore ankle) to the mound, Aaron Judge, he of the .345 average and 37 home runs,\u00a0 was grabbing a bat to get ready to leadoff the inning.\\n\u201cHe was at 65 pitches after the fifth,\u201d Thomson said. \u201cAnd his limit was probably 85. \u00a0So we were going hitter to hitter right there. We had (Tanner) Banks ready to go.\u201d Walker got a groundout from Judge on four pitches, and retired Cody Bellinger, who earlier homered, on a flyout with six pitches. After getting Giancarlo Stanton down 0-2, the DH hit the sixth pitch of the at-bat into the Yankees bullpen for a 3-2 lead.\\n\u201cHe was great,\u201d said Thomson. \u201cHe gave up three home runs but they\u2019re all solo. He didn\u2019t walk a guy. They got a lot of soft contact. I thought he was really good.\u201d\\nAll this came after Walker tweaked his right ankle on a bouncing ball up the middle in the second inning. After a lengthy meeting on the mound with trainers and Thomson, Walker waved them off and continued.\\n\u201cI thought it went well,\u201d said Walker of his 5.2 innings in which he allowed six hits and three earned runs. \u201cGot into the sixth and really wanted to get that last out but just left it over the middle. Supposed to be a two-seam in there, try to get some weak contact. I thought overall it was good.\u201d\\nThe Phillies offense didn\u2019t have much weak contact on the night as Trea Turner got on base five times as he and Schwarber combined to go 7-for-10 with six runs scored.\\nBefore the game, Thomson spoke of the recent uptick in the offensive production from Realmuto. Thomson alluded to when Realmuto is at his best, he hits the ball to center and right field.\\nMaybe the veteran catcher got wind of Thomson\u2019s remarks and wanted to show that\u2019s not all he can do. Realmuto turned perfectly into a Luke Weaver changeup and launched it deep into the left-field seats to give the Phillies a 6-3 lead in the seventh.\\n\u201cI feel like mechanically I\u2019ve been in a better spot recently, starting to feel good, my timing\u2019s felt better and seeing the ball better,\u201d said Realmuto. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s heading in the right direction. It\u2019s mostly timing with me.

And I say that because, I watched Barry Bonds and the season he had. I was in center field for it. And what Barry did was hands-down one of the greatest seasons you can have.\\n\u201cShawn Green is a memory you have, I think Shawn hit four homers in a game in Dodger Stadium. But tonight was special. This kid continues to have jaw-dropping moments. And to witness that tonight was pretty special for all of us.\u201d\\nThe Athletics took Kurtz with the No. 4 overall pick on July 14 last year, and they clearly hit a home run with that selection.\\nJust over a year later, the Wake Forest product arguably is the hottest big-league hitter at the moment.\\nIt\u2019s a remarkable ascension for the 22-year-old.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely crazy,\u201d Kurtz told Caray and Braden. \u201cTo think a year ago I was probably in Arizona right now, right after the draft and just getting ready to go out and play in Stockton and now I\u2019m here and today kind of happened, it\u2019s insane. I kinda, I don\u2019t know what to say Dallas. I mean I got no idea.\u201d\\nMaybe even more remarkable is that Kurtz\u2019s family made it to Houston just in time to watch his otherworldly performance.\\n\u201cTo see Pops and Mom there and the godparents as well, it\u2019s pretty awesome to have them here,\u201d Kurtz told Caray and Braden. \u201c[They] just got in this morning, so going to be here is really cool.\u201d\\nThere are over two months left in the 2025 season, but it might be a safe bet to start inscribing Kurtz\u2019s name on the AL Rookie of the Year award. He has been that good over the last few weeks.\\n        Published: Fri, 25 Jul 2025 23:29:15 +0000\\n        Source: NBC Sports Philadelphia\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Facing Dodgers for first time gives Walker Buehler chance to reflect on his time in L.A.\\n        Description: Walker Buehler doesn't regret signing with the Boston Red Sox in the offseason despite becoming an instant World Series hero for the Dodgers last October.\\n        Link: https://sports.yahoo.com/article/facing-dodgers-first-time-gives-232727521.html\\n        Content: It had been nine months since Walker Buehler struck out Alex Verdugo, stretched his arms on the Yankee Stadium mound, and was dogpiled after recording the final outs of last year\u2019s World Series .\\nBut on Friday afternoon, ahead of Buehler\u2019s first reunion with the Dodgers since departing for the Boston Red Sox in the offseason, the memory remained vividly fresh \u2014 for him, his former teammates and coaches, and even a traveling contingent of Dodgers fans in town for this weekend\u2019s series at Fenway Park.\\nAs Buehler chatted with members of his old organization hours before Friday\u2019s series opener, Dodger fans taking a pregame tour of the stadium spotted him on the diamond. Within moments, an otherwise empty ballpark was echoing with cheers and applause, the fans shouting Buehler\u2019s name as he acknowledged them with a wave of his hand.\\n\u201cThat was really cool,\u201d Buehler said later, the moment reminding him of a conversation he had with Dodgers broadcaster Orel Hershiser (a World Series hero of a different generation who became a mentor of Buehler\u2019s during his time with the team).\\nRead more: Beyond the bullpen, how aggressive will the Dodgers be at the MLB trade deadline?\\n\u201cTalking to Orel about some of that stuff that he\u2019s gone through and the way people react to him, I think it\u2019s obviously two different situations,\u201d he added. \u201cBut for the fans walking around to yell at me, I kind of imagine in L.A. it\u2019ll be like that for a while, I hope.\u201d\\nIndeed, if there was any doubt about how Buehler\u2019s Dodgers tenure was destined to be remembered, his role in last year\u2019s World Series enshrined it in legendary status.\\nNo, the right-hander didn\u2019t quite reach the Cy Young-winning expectations many had when he first came up as a highly touted prospect with a big fastball and fiery mound presence. For as dominant as he was from 2018-2021, when he went 39-13 with a 2.82 earned-run average and two All-Star selections, the end of his seven-year stint was derailed by a 2022 Tommy John surgery (the second of his career) and a disappointing regular-season performance upon his return in 2024 (when he was 1-6 in the regular season with a 5.38 ERA).\\nBuehler\u2019s best Dodger moments, though, always came in the postseason: From his division-clinching gem in Game 163 as a rookie in 2018, to his 1.80 ERA in five starts during the Dodgers\u2019 2020 World Series run, to when he took the ball on short rest twice in a failed title defense in 2021, to his 10 consecutive scoreless innings in the final two rounds of last year\u2019s postseason most of all; an unexpected star turn following his post-Tommy John struggles throughout the summer.\\n\u201cThat moment means a lot to all of us, that we were a part of it with the city and the fans that came out every day for us there,\u201d he said, while talking to reporters in the Red Sox\u2019s home dugout. \u201cI think it would have been hard to leave that for anywhere \u2014 except for here.\u201d\\nWhile Buehler expressed interest in remaining with the Dodgers ahead of his free agency last winter, his eventual departure became clear in the first week of the offseason.\\nThe team didn\u2019t extend him a one-year, $21.05 million qualifying offer \u2014 which ended up being the same amount he signed for with the Red Sox. The Dodgers instead went after Blake Snell with a $182-million contract, and won the January sweepstakes for Japanese phenom Roki Sasaki.\\n\u201cIt was an interesting situation. I think there\u2019s obviously two sides to that situation,\u201d Buehler said when reflecting back on his free agency. \u201cWe had conversations about it, we talked through it. And they went and signed guys that they wanted to sign. And I signed with a place that I wanted to play. It kind of is what it is.\u201d\\nRead more: Shaikin: Walker Buehler struggling to rediscover his Dodgers World Series magic with Red Sox\\nIn hindsight, it was an outcome neither side  seems to  regret.\\nIn Buehler\u2019s absence, the Dodgers have managed to work around first-half injuries to several key starters, and are on track to have a potential postseason rotation featuring Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Tyler Glasnow, Shohei Ohtani and Snell (who could return from a shoulder injury after one last minor league rehab start with triple-A Oklahoma City on Saturday).\\nMeanwhile, Buehler said he has enjoyed playing for the Red Sox, even though he has regressed with a woeful 5.72 ERA (sixth-worst in the majors among 107 pitchers with at least 80 innings).\\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a really fun year, outside of some of the playing stuff for me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut my family and me, we\u2019re loving it here and have felt really very welcomed here, as well, just like we were in L.A.\u201d\\nBuehler has been better lately, giving up just three earned runs in his last 18 innings to help the Red Sox maintain the final wild-card spot in the American League.\\nHis next start, fittingly, will come in Sunday\u2019s series-finale against the Dodgers.\\n\u201cIt'll be interesting,\u201d Buehler said with a laugh. \u201cObviously, I was one of the last of the wave coming up there. So I\u2019ve kind of got little bits and pieces of it playing against Joc [Pederson] and [Cody Bellinger] and Corey [Seager]. So it\u2019ll be nine of those for me, I guess.\u201d\\nBuehler wished he could have squared off against Clayton Kershaw; something he said he and the future Hall of Fame left-hander (who will instead pitch Saturday\u2019s game) joked about while meeting up on Thursday\u2019s off day.\\nStill, Buehler added, \\\"I think you just try to keep it as normal as you can. Obviously it'll be a little awkward or funny or whatever. But I don't know. At the end of the day, we're all playing a sport for a paycheck. The goal is go and to get one over on them. I don't think the preparation against them is really different.\\\"\\nFriday, on the other hand, was a day for nostalgia, with Buehler receiving his World Series ring from Dodgers manager Dave Roberts and most of the remaining players from last year\u2019s team during pregame batting practice.\\nRead more: Freddie Freeman's walk-off hit saves the day, lifts Dodgers to win over Twins\\n\u201cI was very fortunate to be drafted and developed and get to spend so much time there,\u201d Buehler said. \u201cShould credit a lot of good success that I've had to them, and how they handled and treated me. Nothing but good things to say there.\\\"\\nAs for if his ring \u2014 a diamond-studded reminder of what, for now at least, remains the lasting image of his Dodgers career \u2014 gave him any closure, Buehler smirked.\\n\\\"I think you already have it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think everyone kind of knows I'm on a one-year contract, so you never know what's going to happen down the road.\u201d\\nThe Dodgers were without shortstop Mookie Betts, who was home in Nashville with his family attending to a personal matter. Roberts said Betts was expected to rejoin the club on Saturday, but was unsure if he\u2019d be back in the starting lineup for that day\u2019s game.\\nSign up for more Dodgers news with Dodgers Dugout.

Even then, there was still plenty of depth in the bullpen because of everything else that has gone on this week.\\nThe Giants are currently carrying four right-handers who could be described as long relievers, the result of optioning Hayden Birdsong and losing Landen Roupp to elbow inflammation .\\nThe rotation, a strength for much of the first half, is leaking oil, and the staff ace is not exempt.\\nWebb was charged with six earned in an 8-1 loss to the New York Mets. He has given up 16 earned over his last three starts \u2013 the worst such stretch of his career.\\nWhat\u2019s going on?\\n\u201cIf I knew, I would have fixed it by now,\u201d he said. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s just not good.\u201d\\nIf there is something that is bothering Webb physically, he won\u2019t use it as an excuse.\\nAsked about his workload on Friday, he said he feels fine and pointed out that this is what he gets paid to do. \u201cI\u2019ve got to be better,\u201d he repeated.\\nThe latest disappointing start came a few hours after the Giants announced that Roupp will miss at least two starts with tightness in his right elbow.\\nEarlier this week, they sent Birdsong back to Triple-A after he failed to record an out in a nightmare start against the Atlanta Braves.\\nThere is a bullpen game on the schedule for Sunday and that likely won\u2019t change, even after Webb tied a season-low for outs recorded. The group that walked in from the bullpen late Friday night included Carson Seymour and Sean Hjelle , both of whom can give Melvin some length.\\nTo get through Friday\u2019s loss, the manager used Tristan Beck and Spencer Bivens , among others.\\nBarring a disastrous start from Robbie Ray on Saturday, the Giants will go to their deep pen on Sunday and then figure out what to do with Roupp\u2019s turn. Carson Whisenhunt and Kai-Weig Teng seem to be the leading options, with the hope that Roupp will be back in a couple of weeks.\\nThe Giants also could trade for reinforcements over the next six days, although on Friday it was hard to make the argument that this team should push too many additional chips into the center of the table.\\nIn front of a sellout crowd, the lineup repeatedly let Clay Holmes off the hook. The loss was the fifth in seven games since the All-Star break.\\nIn the first half, the slow stretches could be put just about entirely on the offense. But over the past week, question marks have popped up with the rotation, which went seven deep at the start of the season and now has just three healthy starters.\\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to put the team in a better spot. I\u2019ve got to be better,\u201d Webb added. \u201cIt sucks losing Roupp \u2014 honestly he\u2019s probably throwing the best out of all of us right now. It sucks losing him and I know he\u2019s upset about it, but we all just have to step up and be better than what I did today.\u201d\\nDownload and follow the Giants Talk Podcast\\n\\n        Published: Fri, 25 Jul 2025 23:19:38 +0000\\n        Source: NBC Sports BayArea\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: What we learned as Giants' offense, Logan Webb come out flat in loss to Mets\\n        Description: The Giants offense and Logan Webb came out flat in another lackluster loss to the New York Mets on Friday at Oracle Park.\\n        Link: https://www.nbcsportsbayarea.com/mlb/san-francisco-giants/logan-webb-new-york-mets/1863910/?partner=yahoo\\n        Content: What we learned as Giants' offense, Logan Webb come out flat in loss to Mets originally appeared on NBC Sports Bay Area\\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Between innings on Friday night, the Giants\u2019 stadium\u00a0operations crew played a game of \u201cRemembering Some Guys.\u201d Russ Ortiz, Tyler Walker and Jean Machi were all at Oracle Park, and they were shown on the scoreboard and remembered as Forever Giants.\\nThe former\u00a0Giants pitchers were not treated to a good performance.\\nLogan Webb had a third straight rough start and the lineup couldn\u2019t keep the Atlanta vibes going, losing 8-1 to the New York Mets.\\nAs they kicked off a six-game homestand against the Mets and Pittsburgh Pirates that will lead right into the trade deadline, the Giants fell for the fifth time in seven games since the All-Star break.\\nHere are three things to know from a disappointing start to the homestand:\\nWebb pitched well in the All-Star Game, but the rest of this month has been surprisingly rocky. He lasted just four innings Friday, tying a season low, and he tied a season high by allowing six earned runs. Webb gave up just 10 earned runs in his first 10 starts at Oracle Park this season, but he has allowed 12 earned runs over his past two home starts against the Los Angeles Dodgers and Mets.\\nFriday\u2019s trouble started early, after Webb gave up a leadoff double and a single. The Mets scored two in the first, and Francisco Lindor hit a solo homer in the third. Webb gave up three singles and walked one in the fourth before recovering to strike out Lindor and Juan Soto, but the damage had been done. The staff ace had a 2.62 ERA after a quality start in Sacramento at the beginning of July, but it\u2019s now up to 3.38.\\nWhen he walked into Oracle Park this week, it was Matt Gage\u2019s first visit since 2015, when he was a recent Giants draft pick who took part in their January rookie camp \u2014 which included a run to the Golden Gate Bridge and another day when prospects ran up and down every set of stairs in the upper deck.\\nGage, now 32, never made it to the big leagues in his first go-around with the Giants, but he has pitched well since returning this month. The lefty opened the seventh by blowing a fastball past Lindor and then got a pop-up from Soto and a groundout from Pete Alonso. In four scoreless innings with the Giants, Gage has allowed just one hit.\\nRafael Devers made his second start at first base, and it was uneventful. Devers looked comfortable, and his bothersome back and groin didn\u2019t seem to be impacted by a cold night at Oracle Park.\\nDevers went 1-for-4 at the plate with an early double that helped get the Giants on the board. After Heliot Ramos led off the first with a single, Devers hooked a changeup from Clay Holmes into the right field corner. Ramos scored on a groundout by Willy Adames.\\nDownload and follow the Giants Talk Podcast\\n\\n        Published: Fri, 25 Jul 2025 22:06:02 +0000\\n        Source: NBC Sports BayArea\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Nick Kurtz's historic 4-HR barrage is latest proof that 'The Big Amish' is slugging his way into AL Rookie of the Year race\\n        Description: The Athletics' first baseman, along with rookie shortstop Jacob Wilson, gives the team a young hitting tandem to build around.\\n        Link: https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/nick-kurtzs-historic-4-hr-barrage-is-latest-proof-that-the-big-amish-is-slugging-his-way-into-al-rookie-of-the-year-race-220255810.html\\n        Content: For the first time in his young career, 22-year-old first baseman Nick Kurtz was named AL Player of the Week on Monday after his highly productive showing in the Athletics\u2019 first series of the second half vs. Cleveland.\\nWith the All-Star festivities having put a pause on the regular season, this award, doled out weekly by the league office, didn\u2019t cover the usual sample of six or seven games played over a week. Instead, it highlighted just the first weekend after the break. And in that abbreviated sample, Kurtz mashed to an outstanding degree, collecting multiple hits in all three games at Progressive Field, including five of the extra-base variety.\\nOn the surface, it\u2019s a modest accomplishment for the rookie first baseman, the first official accolade in a career that promises to feature plenty more. At the same time, \u201cplayer of the week\u201d wholly undersells what Kurtz has been doing at the plate lately. Because he was not just the star of this past week(end). He has been the best hitter in baseball for the past nine weeks .\\nKurtz put the baseball world on further notice Friday with a historic night at the plate, as he became the first rookie in MLB history to hit four home runs in a game in a 15-3 blowout of the Houston Astros . He went 6-for-6 with eight RBI and 19 total bases in what many have called one of the greatest offensive performances ever. It was enough to make Kurtz the new betting favorite to win AL Rookie of the Year, according to BetMGM .\\n[ Join or create a Yahoo Fantasy Football league for the 2025 NFL season ]\\nNICK KURTZ BECOMES THE FIRST ROOKIE WITH A FOUR-HOMER GAME IN MLB HISTORY \ud83e\udd2f (via @MLB ) pic.twitter.com/W8IQtfXk5x\\nThe A's broadcasters toasted the feat in the booth with a butter churn celebration, paying homage to Kurtz's \\\"Big Amish\\\" nickname, given to him to acknowledge his Lancaster, Pennsylvania, roots.\\n\\\"It's hard to think about this day being kind of real. It still feels like a dream,\\\" Kurtz said postgame via ESPN .\\nBut it's real. Since the end of May, neither Aaron Judge nor Cal Raleigh nor Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr. nor Kurtz\u2019s NL Player of the Week counterpart, red-hot trade candidate Eugenio Su\u00e1rez , has been as dominant with the bat as the A\u2019s rookie. Over the past 42 games before Friday's explosion, Kurtz was hitting .327/.408/.782 with 18 home runs, good for a 1.190 OPS and 217 wRC+ that were both tops in baseball.\\n\\n\u201cI think Nick's put himself, in a very short time, in conversation about Rookie of the Year,\u201d A\u2019s manager Mark Kotsay said in Cleveland. \u201cWe've got one on the team right now that's probably a little ahead of him in Jacob [Wilson]. But it's fun to watch these two, and it's going to be fun to watch them over the next 64 games and the progress they're able to make.\u201d\\nIndeed, Wilson\u2019s marvelous first half, which led to him starting the All-Star Game at shortstop for the AL, has somewhat overshadowed Kurtz\u2019s prolonged hot streak. But make no mistake: Both are succeeding to a degree achieved by very few rookie hitters as they emerge as one of the most promising young position-player duos in baseball.\\n\u201cNick, he's still learning the league,\u201d Kotsay said. \u201cJacob got a little head start on him.\\n\u201cBut Nick seems to be a quick learner.\u201d\\nThree weeks of torching Triple-A pitching earned Kurtz his big-league call-up on April 23, roughly nine months after he was selected fourth overall in the 2024 MLB Draft. It wasn\u2019t smooth sailing at first: After he hit his first home run on May 13, Kurtz fell into an 0-for-21 skid that plummeted his OPS to a paltry .558.\\nBut Kurtz didn\u2019t panic. And those who observed how he went about his business in the earliest days of his big-league tenure were unsurprised when he began to not just dig himself out of that hole but also flourish in spectacular fashion upon finding his footing.\\n\u201cHe had to go through some struggles, like everybody does, and he didn't press,\u201d A's hitting coach Chris Cron said. \u201cIt wasn't a major deal. Of course he wanted to do well, but it wasn't the end of the world.\u201d\\n\u201cWhen you come billed with the kind of power he came with, to not be able to tap into that readily and immediately, I think you would see some guys start to scramble,\u201d former A\u2019s pitcher and current broadcaster Dallas Braden said. \u201cInstead, what he did was cut the swing down and spray the baseball all over the yard until he got comfortable to a point where he could dip back into that power pool.\u201d\\nIt took some time for Kurtz to tweak his patented patient approach, which he mastered as an amateur, to fit the unique challenge of hitting major-league pitching.\\n\u201cIf you wait for your pitch, you're probably striking out on three pitches,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's all about adjusting on the fly and pitch-to-pitch. Some guys, you need to be aggressive on pitches that aren't necessarily your pitch. When I first got up, I was trying to be a little too patient. Being down 0-1, 0-2, 1-2 so much \u2026 this game is so hard.\u201d\\nKurtz realized early on that he needed to take control of his at-bats, rather than letting the pitcher dictate the terms of engagement. And behind the scenes, he was making adjustments to allow his strengths to manifest against more daunting competition.\\n\u201cHis ability just to communicate what he's trying to do, understand the information that we're throwing out there \u2014 that doesn't just happen with a snap of the finger,\u201d Cron said. \u201cYou tell him something, he can absorb, and he can apply. Application of the information is the hardest thing to grasp, and he does that.\u201d\\nSaid All-Star teammate Brent Rooker: \u201cTo have as high-level approaches as he has as a 22-year-old, and then to also go out and execute them and execute them with the power that he does \u2026 That makes him stand out.\u201d\\nSoon enough, Kurtz began to better understand when to unleash his thunderous left-handed swing \u2014 \u201cIt's about playing the game and the situations,\u201d he said \u2014 and the results followed.\\n\u201cOnce he found himself in 2-0, 2-1s, 3-0, 3-1s,\u201d Braden said, \u201cnow it's go time.\u201d\\nWith that, Kurtz took off. On May 20 , he snapped his hitless skid with a single and a home run against the Angels. Two more homers followed the next day. A strained left hip flexor put Kurtz on the injured list later that week and threatened to derail his newfound momentum, but the brief injury scare was no trouble. It took just one minor-league rehab game \u2014 he homered, of course \u2014 before Kurtz rejoined the A\u2019s lineup and resumed raking.\\nAs the home runs kept coming, each seismic swing seemed to carry greater weight than the last: A go-ahead blast off Royals closer Carlos Est\u00e9vez in the top of the ninth in Kansas City. Two walk-off homers against the Astros off elite relievers in Bryan Abreu and Josh Hader. A titanic, three-run shot in Detroit \u2014 the only home run ball to reach the shrubbery beyond the center-field wall at Comerica Park this season \u2014 that provided the only runs in a 3-0 victory over the Tigers. And that magical Friday night against the Astros.\\n\\nWhether in pregame batting practice or in high-stakes battles against some of the best pitchers on the planet, the power that was promised during Kurtz\u2019s brief time as a prospect has consistently been on display this season. Most remarkably, Kurtz\u2019s ability to clear the fence from foul pole to foul pole is nearly unrivaled; not even Judge has hit more home runs to the opposite field or straightaway center since the start of June .\\nAnd when Kurtz is going good, the homers tend to come in bunches. It happened last spring, when he hit 14 homers in a 10-game span after a cold start to his junior season at Wake Forest. It happened before his call-up this year, when he hit seven homers across 12 games in Triple-A. Now it\u2019s happening at the highest level, with a five-homers-in-six-games run in June and an 11-homers-in-14-games stretch in July.\\nKurtz did his best to describe what it\u2019s like to be so locked in: \\\"It's probably one of the best feelings, knowing when you're up there \u2014 honestly, it doesn't matter whether you get a hit or not \u2014 but I know what I'm feeling in my swing, I know exactly where [the bat] is going. I'm seeing the ball \u2014 it's huge right now. It's kind of what you dream about.\u201d\\n\\\"It amazes me,\u201d said Rooker, who was also a first-round draft pick out of college but didn\u2019t blossom into an impact big-league bat until his age-28 season. \u201cI was a very, very good college player. And if you had thrown me in the big leagues at 22, I would\u2019ve absolutely had no chance.\u201d\\n[ Get more A's news: Athletics team feed ]\\nRooker\u2019s more gradual development only increases his appreciation for how Kurtz and Wilson have hit the ground running as rookies.\\n\u201cTheir ability to just jump right in and have success immediately and adjust as quickly as they have, I don't think people realize how difficult that is,\u201d he said.\\nAdding to the unique dynamic of this unrivaled rookie duo is how drastically different they are as players. Wilson is a skinny, right-handed shortstop who thrives on a hyper-aggressive approach and succeeds thanks to his nearly unparalleled bat-to-ball skills. Kurtz is a gargantuan, left-handed first baseman who whiffs often but pulverizes the ball so frequently that the punchouts are entirely tolerable.\\n\\n\u201cI don't think there's one way, from a hitting standpoint, to tell somebody how to do it,\u201d Kotsay said. \u201cJacob has his unique style. He's a bat-to-ball guy that puts it in play and sometimes seems to have a magic wand where he can hit it where he wants to. I played with a guy like that \u2014 Tony Gwynn \u2014 who had that magic wand.\\n\u201cAnd for Nick, when he touches it, he impacts the baseball, and he can leave anywhere in the yard. They're definitely two different styles of hitters, but they have an advanced approach for how young they are in knowing who they are and knowing what they're trying to do.\u201d\\nSaid Wilson of his counterpart: \u201cWhen we drafted him, it was obviously a huge bat for us to go out and get, and as you can see, it's translating to the big-league level pretty nicely right now. Definitely happy to have him on the team, excited to hopefully play with him for a very long time.\u201d\\nKurtz\u2019s and Wilson\u2019s Baseball Savant pages are opposites to a spectacular degree , a fitting reflection of each player leaning all the way in on what he does best. To Rooker, this is a great sign.\\n\\\"The key to having success here is knowing what you're good at and then just being as good as you possibly can be at those things,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody here is doing something at an elite level. ... You have to figure out what that thing is, and you have to be as good as you possibly can at that. There's a ton of value, obviously, in trying to improve your weaknesses. [But] I think there's more value in finding your superpower and doing that as well as you possibly can. And I think those two guys are perfect examples of that.\u201d\\n\\nFor as impressive of a start to his career as Kurtz has had, he knows this is just the beginning. \\\"I put zero expectations on myself in Year 1,\u201d he said. \u201cI had no idea what I was getting into.\u201d\\nHe also will not stay this hot forever; another round of adjustments is surely in store, a regression to reality that will put his advanced aptitude to the test once again. And for the Athletics as a whole \u2014 a franchise in a transition between cities, with an inexperienced yet ascendent roster still figuring out how to translate talent into victories \u2014 every game is another opportunity to grow together.\\n\u201cThat's the best part about what we've developed here with some of those young guys \u2014 they're coming up together,\u201d Cron said. \u201cAnd these two guys, Jacob, with his lineage, with his dad playing [in the big leagues], he's been around the game. The maturity of Nick Kurtz is off the charts. Physically, they're not the same, but they have this mindset of, \u2018Yes, \u2019 \u2014 without being braggadocious \u2014 \u2018I'm a big leaguer.\u2019 And there's nothing that really fazes either one of them.\u201d\\nVeterans such as Rooker will continue to play a critical role in these young players\u2019 development, and Kurtz is quick to credit the A's DH, as well as the recently released Seth Brown. But Kurtz also knows that the franchise\u2019s future depends on his generation becoming the driving force behind the team's success.\\n\u201cWe might not all know the answers,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we're in it together, and we're gonna figure it out.\u201d\\n        Published: Fri, 25 Jul 2025 22:02:55 +0000\\n        Source: Yahoo Sports\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Jazz Chisholm Jr. breaks down new Mets reliever Gregory Soto: 'He\u2019s one of the best'\\n        Description: Yankees' Jazz Chisholm Jr. was willing to provide a scouting report on the Mets\u2019 newest acquisition, LHP Gregory Soto.\\n        Link: https://sny.tv/articles/jazz-chisholm-jr-breaks-down-new-mets-reliever-gregory-soto\\n        Content: Hey Jazz Chisholm Jr. , did you know that you have the most at-bats of any Yankee against Gregory Soto ?\\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Chisholm says, standing in the Yankee dugout Friday afternoon. \u201cAnd probably the least amount of hits.\u201d\\nWell, tied for the least, with zero.

For that reason, Baldwin remains available in 80 percent of Yahoo leagues, even after the Braves turned him into a full-time player by putting Marcell Ozuna on the bench last weekend. He\u2019s since started seven straight games, four at catcher and three at DH.\\nWith Ozuna seemingly likely to be moved at the deadline, Baldwin should get all of the playing time he can handle the rest of the way, making him the NL Rookie of the Year favorite. He\u2019s certainly looked the part thus far in batting .284/.353/.479 with 11 homers. The league as a whole this year has 27% more hard-hit balls than strikeouts. Baldwin has 123% more (89 hard-hit balls, 40 strikeouts). His 50.9% hard-hit rate places him 31st of the 268 batters with 200 plate appearances. Will Smith and Hunter Goodwin are the only catchers hitting at least .280 with at least 10 homers.\\nMaybe Baldwin will wear down some, but all of the DH time will help.

Right now, though, I have him eighth among catchers, and I\u2019d be willing to move on from guys like J.T.

Those numbers are actually better than usual this season.\\nMcMahon, who was dealt to the Yankees for two pitching prospects on Friday, is currently averaging 94.0 mph off the bat, seventh best in the majors. His top-end numbers aren\u2019t as great -- for instance, he\u2019s just 46th when it comes to 90th percentile exit velocity -- but that\u2019s still a lot of hard contact. He\u2019s also hitting more flyballs and pulling the ball more than usual this year. It seems like a recipe for success, but there have been a lot of shots to the warning track thus far. He\u2019s also probably been unlucky; Statcast has him with a .466 xSLG, compared to .403 in reality. He\u2019s never experienced any sort of gap like that previously.\\nObviously, the strikeouts really hold McMahon back. He was leading the NL with 127 this season, which is remarkable for a guy playing in the league\u2019s preeminent strikeout-suppressing ballpark. The Yankees probably have some ideas on how to help him there, but one can\u2019t really expect him to improve much in the near future. If McMahon\u2019s value does come up in the short term, it will be a product of hitting in a far better lineup and sneaking balls over the right field wall in Yankee Stadium. It\u2019s a far worse offensive ballpark, but it\u2019s one that yields more homers to left-handers than Coors does. Unless the Yankees platoon him against southpaws -- they probably ought to, but I\u2019m guessing he\u2019ll be a full-timer initially -- he\u2019s probably a better rest-of-season bet today than he was yesterday.\\nBradish pitched in a game Thursday for the first time since Tommy John surgery, throwing two innings and allowing one run for High-A Aberdeen. The stadium gun had him at 94-96 mph, said MLB.com\u2019s Jake Rill , putting right back where he was before getting hurt. That bodes well for a right-hander who had emerged as one of the AL\u2019s best pitchers at the time of his injury.\\nA subpar pitcher as a rookie in 2022, Bradish busted out about a month into the 2023 season and wound up posting a 2.42 ERA and a 150/35 K/BB in his final 25 starts that year. Last season, he was just as effective, and his strikeout rate jumped from 25 percent to 33 percent in the eight starts before he got hurt. The league had a hard-hit rate of just 29 percent against his arsenal of two fastballs, a slider and a curve.\\nThat\u2019s not to say Bradish is going to experience the same sort of success right away after returning next month. He might even have a setback before then, and given that the Orioles are out of contention, any sort of setback would probably get him shut down until 2026. However, if his rehab continues to progress smoothly, he could be quite an asset over the final six weeks of the season. Those who look to wait until his rehab is complete to pick him up will probably find they missed out.\\n- I\u2019m not going to write about rotation-bound Joe Boyle again so soon after featuring him recently , but he ought to be picked up everywhere after the Rays\u2019 demotion of Taj Bradley. Instead, he\u2019s only 15 percent rostered now.\\n- The Astros\u2019 Cristian Javier doesn\u2019t need to be picked up just yet as he works his way back from Tommy John, but it was really encouraging that he averaged 93.6 mph with his fastball in his first Triple-A start. That\u2019s back where he was in 2021 and \u201922 before falling off in 2023 (92.8 mph) and 2024 (91.7). I doubt we\u2019ll ever again see the Javier of 2022 (2.54 ERA, 33% K rate in 149 IP), but on a fine Houston team, he doesn\u2019t need to be that good to offer some value.\\n        Published: Fri, 25 Jul 2025 19:52:36 +0000\\n        Source: NBC Sports\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Yankees acquire third baseman Ryan McMahon from the Rockies for pair of prospects\\n        Description: McMahon leaves the last-place Rockies for a Yankees team that\u2019s in the thick of a playoff chase.\\n        Link: https://www.nbcsports.com/mlb/news/report-yankees-acquire-third-baseman-ryan-mcmahon-from-rockies-for-prospects\\n        Content: DENVER (AP)  The New York Yankees acquired third baseman Ryan McMahon from the Colorado Rockies on Friday, giving them a veteran at a position of need as they try to stop their slide down the AL East standings.\\nThe Yankees sent pitching prospects Josh Grosz and Griffin Herring to Colorado.\\nThe 30-year-old McMahon, an All-Star a year ago, was hitting .217 with 16 home runs and 35 RBIs for last-place Colorado.

Mayer sustained the injury during Wednesday\u2019s win over the Philadelphia Phillies.\\n\u201cI took a checked swing in my first at-bat, and I kind of felt my wrist a little bit,\u201d Mayer told reporters Friday at Fenway Park. \u201cDidn\u2019t think much of it. Was able to throw the ball fine. Second at-bat, the second swing of my at-bat, I just felt like my wrist locked up.\u201d\\nMayer\u2019s return timetable is unclear. According to Tim Healey of The Boston Globe , when asked whether the injury would require surgery, Red Sox manager Alex Cora said the club is \u201cgathering information\u201d and will \u201cget more over the weekend, during the week.\u201d\\nMayer experienced a similar injury that sidelined him for several games early in the 2022 season.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s brutal,\u201d he added. \u201cObviously, this is not a spot I want to be in. I want to be out there playing every day, trying to help the team win. As an athlete, all we want to do is play and go out there and just do what we do best.

All I can do now is try to get better from it, keep working hard and try to get back on the field as soon as possible.\u201d\\nThe Red Sox called up speedy middle infielder David Hamilton to replace Mayer on the active roster. Center fielder Ceddanne Rafaela will take Mayer\u2019s spot at second base for Friday\u2019s game against the Dodgers.\\nFirst pitch for the Red Sox-Dodgers series opener at Fenway Park is set for 7:10 p.m. ET.\\n        Published: Fri, 25 Jul 2025 18:52:33 +0000\\n        Source: NBC Sports Boston\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Giants hope Landen Roupp's elbow injury was caught in time amid rotation trouble\\n        Description: San Francisco manager Bob Melvin hopes Landen Roupp's right elbow injury was caught in time amid the Giants' starting rotation woes.\\n        Link: https://www.nbcsportsbayarea.com/mlb/san-francisco-giants/landen-roupps-elbow-injury-rotation/1863850/?partner=yahoo\\n        Content: Giants hope Landen Roupp's elbow injury was caught in time amid rotation trouble originally appeared on NBC Sports Bay Area\\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When asked in recent weeks about his workload, Landen Roupp has always had the same answer.\\nThe 26-year-old intends to be ready to pitch\u00a0for the Giants in October, and he has certainly done his part to keep them in the playoff race.\\nThat was put on hold Friday when Roupp went on the IL with right elbow inflammation , but an MRI showed no structural damage and both Roupp and manager Bob Melvin said the goal is to get the team\u2019s third-best starter back when he is eligible to come off the IL. That would mean missing just two starts, although with any elbow discomfort,\u00a0there is going to be some uncertainty\u00a0about the true timetable.\\nFor now, the Giants and Roupp are optimistic that the discomfort was caught in time.\\nRoupp said he first felt some tightness after his start against the Los Angeles Dodgers on the last homestand. There was additional tightness in Atlanta on Tuesday, leading Melvin to pull Roupp after five shutout innings even though he was only at 87 pitches.\\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s pretty minor,\u201d Melvin told reporters on Friday. \u201cI think we caught it at the right time. We were kind of considering maybe just skipping him a turn, but with the IL being 15 days, it basically comes down to two starts. We\u2019re hopeful that he\u2019s going to be able to come back out after that.\u201d\\nThe Giants already had a gap in their rotation after optioning Hayden Birdsong to Triple-A on Tuesday, a day after he failed to record an out and walked four in the first inning. The first opening will arrive Sunday, and the plan is to go with a bullpen game in place of Birdsong, at least for this turn. Roupp is likely to be replaced by another young starter, and the Giants have several options.\\nCarson Seymour is already up in the big leagues and available out of the bullpen, and he is stretched out enough to make a start.\\nCarson Whisenhunt will also be an option, and that would turn into a highly-anticipated event. The lefty is the organization\u2019s best pitching prospect.\\nThe Giants are also considering Kai-Wei Teng , who struggled in four appearances last year and was taken off the 40-man roster in the offseason. Teng has been the best of the Triple-A pitchers in recent weeks and has 82 strikeouts in 52 1/3 innings this season.\\nWhen the Birdsong and Roupp spots come back around a second time, it\u2019s possible the Giants have an additional option or two. Rotation depth stands out as their biggest need ahead of the deadline, which is Thursday afternoon.\\nThe staff is confident that Birdsong will figure out his command issues and there is hope with Roupp\u2019s elbow, but both pitchers also face uncertainty. Birdsong\u2019s last start was jarring, and elbow discomfort is never to be taken lightly. Another spot in the rotation is held by Justin Verlander , who just picked up his first win but also has a 4.70 ERA.\\n\u201cLook, it feels like every team goes through it, and sometimes when it rains it pours a little bit,\u201d Melvin added. \u201cWe do have some guys we like in Triple-A as far as the depth goes, so we\u2019ll see where that goes \u2014 and we\u2019ll see what the deadline brings.\u201d\\nDownload and follow the Giants Talk Podcast\\n\\n        Published: Fri, 25 Jul 2025 18:32:19 +0000\\n        Source: NBC Sports BayArea\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Two-start pitchers: Matthew Boyd leads a strong group of options for the week of July 28\\n        Description: Zach Eflin, Max Fried and Cristopher S\u00e1nchez are among the projected two-start pitchers for the upcoming week.\\n        Link: https://sports.yahoo.com/article/two-start-pitchers-matthew-boyd-182226101.html\\n        Content: Hello and welcome to the 17th installment of our weekly two-start pitcher article for the 2025 MLB season.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI'll be here every Friday to highlight some of the best two-start pitcher options in fantasy baseball leagues for the upcoming week, as well as some streaming options to keep in mind.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThinking ahead with your weekly strategy can give you an advantage on the waiver wire and hopefully be a difference-maker in the standings at the end of the season.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is a living document, so we'll update the options below as the weekend moves along.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBefore we get into it, we'll start with a couple of notes on situations that may be unresolved or teams that may not have a two-start pitcher lined up for the upcoming week:\\n\\nSomeone should make two starts for the Braves next week, but as of now we\u2019re still not sure who that person will be after Davis Daniel was optioned back to Triple-A Gwinnett following a rough outing against the Giants. It could be Dane Dunning , but he has already been used twice out of the bullpen and wouldn\u2019t be stretched out yet. Stay tuned, we\u2019ll track this one through the weekend. The two starts we would be looking at here are at the Royals and against the Reds in a neutral location in the MLB Speedway Classic in Bristol. Tennessee.\\nIt's also not clear yet who is going to take the ball for the Angels on Monday. The Angels went with a bullpen game the last time this spot in the rotation came around, with Jake Eder logging six innings in a bulk role out of the bullpen. He has since been optioned back to Triple-A Salt Lake. Carson Fulmer would make some sense, but he pitched an inning out of the bullpen on Thursday so it\u2019s unclear if they want to go in that direction. Stay tuned.\\nWe\u2019re also still waiting for clarity on what the Dodgers are going to do. They play six games next week, so there\u2019s a chance that Yoshinobu Yamamoto will make two starts (@ Reds, @ Rays), but they\u2019re currently rolling with a modified six-man rotation as they stretch out Shohei Ohtani and they\u2019re also expecting Blake Snell to return soon, which could further complicate plans.\\nTentatively, we\u2019re expecting Jacob Misiorowski to make two starts for the Brewers next week (vs. Cubs, @ Nationals), but that\u2019s not a guarantee. Nestor Cortes looks like he is finished with his rehab assignment and should slot into the club\u2019s rotation next week, the issue is there is no place to put him. Do they bring him back in the bullpen or piggyback him with someone else and keep the regular five-man rotation intact? It\u2019s possible. Or they could go with a six-man rotation at least one trip through, which would cost Misiorowski his second start of the week. He\u2019s worth starting every week regardless, so there\u2019s no decision to be made on this inflection point.\\nWe\u2019re also waiting to see who the Rays slot into their rotation to replace the recently demoted Taj Bradley . The most likely candidate is Joe Boyle , who is someone fantasy managers have been hanging onto in the hopes that he finally gets the opportunity. The problem if it happens this week, is he would draw an absolutely brutal two-start week, having to take on the Yankees in the Bronx before battling the vaunted offense of the Dodgers at Steinbrenner Field. We\u2019ll update as we get more information.\\nWithout further ado, let's dig into the options for the week of July 28.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNote: Probable pitchers as of Friday, July 25, and are subject to change.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFramber Valdez , Astros, LHP (vs. Nationals, @ Red Sox)\\nThrough his first 20 starts, Valdez has functioned as a true ace for fantasy managers, posting an 11-4 record, 2.67 ERA, 1.13 WHIP and a 129/42 K/BB ratio over 128 innings. He should be started each and every week without hesitation, it\u2019s just an added bonus that he gets to double his fun this week. He represents one of the top overall options on the board this week and should continue his dominance.\\nMax Fried , Yankees, LHP (vs. Rays, @ Marlins)\\nWhile he has come back to Earth a bit after his brilliant start to the season, Fried still owns a tremendous 11-4 record, 2.62 ERA, 1.04 WHIP and 116/30 K/BB ratio over 127 1/3 innings through his first 21 starts on the season. Now he gets to battle the Rays at home before taking on a weak Marlins\u2019 offense in Miami, which seems like a recipe for success. Fantasy managers should have him locked into lineups regardless of matchups, but this week lines up particularly well for the Yankees\u2019 southpaw.\\nJacob deGrom , Rangers, RHP (@ Angels, @ Mariners)\\nJacob deGrom has managed to stay healthy through his first 20 starts on the season and in turn has delivered excellent results \u2013 going 10-2 with a minuscule 2.28 ERA, 0.90 WHIP and a 122/25 K/BB ratio over his 118 1/3 innings. As long as he continues pitching, he should be locked into fantasy lineups and this juicy two-start week is no exception.\\n\\nSlade Cecconi , Guardians, RHP (vs. Rockies, vs. Twins)\\nCecconi has quietly done a very nice job through his first 12 starts for the Guardians, compiling a 3.76 ERA, 1.23 WHIP and a 60/20 K/BB ratio across 69 1/3 innings. He draws a terrific matchup to start the week, getting to take on the Rockies at home before finishing the week with a home tilt against the Twins. He checks all of the boxes of everything that we\u2019re looking for except for the elite strikeout rate, but that is covered by the extra volume that he\u2019ll see during a two-start week. Even if rain factors in or the Guardians decide to insert a spot starter into their rotation during the week, he still winds up with a single start against the Rockies at home that you would want to use anyways. Cecconi looks like a very strong option in leagues of all sizes for the upcoming week.\\nLuis Castillo , Mariners, RHP (@ Athletics, vs. Rangers)\\nCastillo continues to march on and post quality numbers each week, posting a 3.30 ERA, 1.24 WHIP and a 107/36 K/BB ratio over 120 innings through his first 21 starts. The strikeout rate is down from where we\u2019d expect it to be based on Castillo\u2019s career, but he has still been very effective so it\u2019s a minor gripe. He\u2019s a threat to win every time that he takes the mound and he gets to battle a pair of inferior opponents within his division, which should allow him to add to that total this week. Fire him up in all formats.\\nChris Bassitt , Blue Jays, RHP (@ Orioles, vs. Royals)\\nBassitt has pitched very well for the Jays this season, going 11-4 with a 3.88 ERA, 1.30 WHIP and a 117/29 K/BB ratio over 120 2/3 innings through his first 22 outings. He\u2019s pitching for one of the hottest teams in all of baseball and should be a good bet to add to that win total during his upcoming two-start week against the Orioles and Royals. He can be deployed with confidence in all leagues.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nZach Eflin , Orioles, RHP (vs. Blue Jays, @ Cubs)\\nEflin made his triumphant return from the injured list this past week and pitched fairly well \u2013 striking out five over five innings of two-run baseball in a no-decision against the Guardians. The matchups for the upcoming week are certainly imposing, battling a red-hot Blue Jays\u2019 squad and then having to take on the Cubs at Wrigley Field. Eflin usually keeps his ratios in check though and he should approach double-digit strikeouts over his two-start week. He\u2019s worth starting in 15-teamers for sure and I\u2019d probably roll the dice in most 12-team formats as well.\\nCasey Mize , Tigers, RHP (vs. Diamondbacks, @ Phillies)\\nIf you just glanced as Mize\u2019s season-long line, you would think it\u2019s a no-brainer to throw him out there for a two-start week regardless of his matchups. I\u2019m not so sure that\u2019s the right call. He has been absolutely obliterated in each of his last two starts \u2013 one before and one after the All-Star break \u2013 giving up 10 runs on 16 hits over seven innings against the Mariners and the Pirates. He now has to take on a pair of strong offenses in the Diamondbacks and Phillies, with the second start coming on the road. In 15-teamers it\u2019s hard to get away from this as you are unlikely to have better options, but I wouldn\u2019t be throwing him with much confidence in 12-teamers after the beatings that he just endured.\\nRich Hill , Royals, LHP (vs. Braves, @ Blue Jays)\\nIs it more than just a great story that Rich Hill is back in the big leagues and making starts for the Royals as the oldest player in the league at 45-years-old? It could be. The grizzled southpaw actually looked good in his first start, allowing just one earned run over five innings against the Cubs, though he recorded only one strikeout. The matchups aren\u2019t ideal this week and he\u2019s still unlikely to deliver more than a handful of strikeouts over a two-start week, but there\u2019s some appeal to streaming Hill in deeper leagues. He\u2019s unlikely to blow up your ratios and should at least have a shot at earning a victory. You could surprisingly do a whole lot worse this week.\\nSimeon Woods Richardson , Twins, RHP (vs. Red Sox, @ Guardians)\\nThe 24-year-old right-hander has pitched much better recently, posting a 1.99 ERA, 1.15 WHIP and an 18/12 K/BB ratio over 22 2/3 innings in his last five starts. The problem has been his efficiency, as he hasn\u2019t worked deeper than five innings in any of those starts and has gone 4 2/3 and three innings his last two times out. He should provide decent ratios and a handful of strikeouts, though his chances of earning a victory are diminished with him not working deeply into games. If you\u2019re good with that, then he\u2019s worth a look in all leagues.\\nLogan Evans , Mariners, RHP (@ Athletics, vs. Rangers)\\nDespite an elevated WHIP, Evans has done a nice job through his first 11 starts for the Mariners, compiling a 3.64 ERA, 1.40 WHIP and a 43/21 K/BB ratio across 59 1/3 innings. He\u2019s in a good position to add to his win total this week with matchups against the Athletics and Rangers on tap, which makes him a worthwhile streaming option in shallower leagues in which he may still be hanging around on the waiver wire.\\nPatrick Corbin , Rangers, LHP (@ Angels, @ Mariners)\\nAt this stage of his career Corbin is who he is. Someone who can provide decent ratios, give you a shot at a victory and will pick up a couple of strikeouts every time he takes the mound. That makes him a viable option in most two-start weeks. This time he\u2019ll battle the Angels and Mariners \u2013 both on the road \u2013 where he once again makes for a decent streaming play. There\u2019s not much there in terms of ceiling, but you could do a whole lot worse than streaming Corbin for a pair of starts this week.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJP Sears , Athletics, LHP (vs. Mariners, vs. Diamondbacks)\\nSears has struggled through his first 21 starts for the Athletics this season, posting an underwhelming 4.98 ERA, 1.25 WHIP and a 91/26 K/BB ratio over 106 2/3 innings. Having to pitch twice at Sutter Health Park in West Sacramento doesn\u2019t work in his favor, nor does the fact that he\u2019ll be taking on a couple of strong opposing offenses. The strikeouts should be there given the added volume of a two-start week, but don\u2019t count on Sears for strong ratios and his chances of earning a victory aren\u2019t particularly high.\\nRichard Fitts , Red Sox, RHP (@ Twins, vs. Astros)\\nFitts has shown a bit of rust since returning from the injured list, registering a 5.06 ERA, 1.25 WHIP and a 17/3 K/BB ratio over 16 innings of work while making it through five innings just once over those four starts. The matchups are tough as well, fueling the ratio risk for the upcoming week. If all you\u2019re looking for is strikeouts, he should be able to come through for you there \u2013 and really his WHIP has been in an acceptable range for much of the season. There\u2019s just a chance that he blows up your ERA in one of these outings. Depending on your level of risk tolerance, he could be worth a look as a streaming option in deeper leagues.\\nDavis Martin , White Sox, RHP (vs. Phillies, @ Angels)\\nDepending on what you\u2019re looking for, it\u2019s possible that Martin could be a viable streaming option in deeper formats. He\u2019s not a big strikeout guy, but from the volume of two starts he could claw his way to five or six over the course of the week. He\u2019s also very unlikely to win a game while pitching for the White Sox, but even a blind squirrel finds a nut once in a while. The start against the Phillies looks like a tough matchup, but Martin has done a nice job controlling his ratios this season. There isn\u2019t much upside here, but if you\u2019re looking strictly for volume that\u2019s not going to destroy your ratios, he could be in play.\\nDrew Rasmussen , Rays, RHP (@ Yankees, vs. Dodgers)\\nThis one really depends on what it is that you\u2019re looking for. Rasmusen has been outstanding this season, there\u2019s no denying that. The issue is that the Rays are now limiting his innings and he\u2019s only likely to go three or four innings in each of these starts. If the matchups were better, I\u2019d probably recommend using him, as eight innings of quality ratios and strikeouts would be worth it in most cases, even if he doesn\u2019t earn a win. The problem is that the matchups couldn\u2019t be worse. I don\u2019t think the risk justifies what little upside there is here at the moment. I would sit him if possible in all leagues.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNational League\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMatthew Boyd , Cubs, LHP (@ Brewers, vs. Orioles)\\nMatthew Boyd has been able to avoid the injured list and is putting together a magical campaign in his age-34 season for the Cubs. He holds an 11-3 record, 2.20 ERA, 1.01 WHIP and a 108/24 K/BB ratio across 118 2/3 innings of work over his first 20 starts. He starts the upcoming week with a tough matchup against the Brewers in a critical divisional battle before finishing up with the Orioles at home. He should continue to be treated like a true ace for fantasy purposes, meaning we\u2019re starting him every week without question regardless of the matchups.\\nCristopher S\u00e1nchez , Phillies, LHP (@ White Sox, vs. Tigers)\\nWhile he was snubbed from making his second straight National League All-Star team, S\u00e1nchez has certainly been worthy \u2013 going 9-2 with a 2.40 ERA, 1.09 WHIP and a 134/32 K/BB ratio over 124 innings. He really gets to feast this week, as he\u2019ll battle a hapless White Sox\u2019 offense in Chicago before taking on a struggling Tigers\u2019 offense that has been particularly brutal against left-handed pitching over the last couple of weeks. He should be locked into 100 percent of lineups and represents one of the top overall plays of the week.\\n\\nEdward Cabrera , Marlins, RHP (@ Cardinals, vs. Yankees)\\nThe 27-year-old right-hander has impressed through his first 17 starts with the Marlins this season, posting a 3.48 ERA, 1.24 WHIP and a 92/30 K/BB ratio over 88 innings. He has struck out five or more batters in each of his last 11 starts and has allowed more than two earned runs just twice during that impressive stretch. The matchup against the Yankees is tough, but with the way that Cabrera is throwing the ball at the moment, he should be started in all leagues for this upcoming two-start week.\\nLanden Roupp , Giants, RHP (vs. Pirates, @ Mets)\\nAside from one brutal start against the Dodgers in Los Angeles in mid-June, Roupp has done nothing but dominate since the start of May \u2013 allowing two earned runs or fewer 12 times in his last 14 starts. The walks are a problem, which leads to an elevated WHIP (1.43), but he has been a major asset for fantasy purposes aside from that. He gets a strong matchup against the Pirates to start the week where he\u2019ll be a favorite to earn a victory before finishing things up against the Mets in New York. He can be deployed with confidence in leagues of all sizes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEduardo Rodriguez , Diamondbacks, LHP (@ Tigers, @ Athletics)\\nIt\u2019s been a disappointing season overall for the 32-year-old southpaw, compiling a 5.50 ERA, 1.65 WHIP and a 93/32 K/BB ratio over 86 2/3 innings in his 17 starts. Aside from one disaster against the Royals though, he has actually been decent since the calendar flipped to June \u2013 posting a 3.86 ERA, 1.59 WHIP and a 41/14 K/BB ratio over 42 innings. He also gets the added benefit of facing the Tigers when they\u2019re slumping and can\u2019t score runs to save their lives. The strikeouts should certainly be there over two starts on the week and his chances of earning a victory are elevated this week, making him a decent streaming option in shallow formats where he may still be available.\\nFrankie Montas , Mets, RHP (@ Padres, vs. Giants)\\nDespite his horrific struggles while rehabbing in the minor leagues, Frankie Montas has done a decent job since joining the Mets\u2019 rotation. He has compiled a 4.62 ERA, 1.30 WHIP and a 23/6 K/BB ratio over 25 1/3 innings in his first five starts. He has allowed just three runs over 10 2/3 innings over his last two starts while racking up 11 strikeouts, showing that he\u2019s getting better as he continues to shake off the rust. The matchups are middle of the road, but nothing to shy away from, so I\u2019d be comfortable starting Montas in leagues of all sizes for this upcoming two-start week.\\nMitch Keller , Pirates, RHP (@ Giants, @ Rockies)\\nAssuming that he remains with the Pirates through the trade deadline, Mitch Keller lines up for a very strong two-start week next week. He\u2019ll take on the Giants in an extreme pitcher\u2019s park in San Francisco before traveling to Coors Field to battle a Rockies\u2019 team that has struggled regardless of where they are playing. He\u2019s a strong bet to deliver quality ratios whenever he takes the mound, the downside with Keller has been his limited strikeouts and his poor win equity pitching for the Pirates. Both of those issues are muted this week with him making two starts \u2013 and one of them coming against the Rockies. I\u2019d feel good throwing him out there in leagues of all sizes.\\nDylan Cease , Padres, RHP (vs. Mets, vs. Cardinals)\\nCease has been a bit of an enigma this season. He\u2019s got a poor ERA (4.59) which comes from a few brutal outings in which he gets knocked around, but then he\u2019ll go out and dominate over his next couple of starts without rhyme or reason. We know what he\u2019s never going to be a major asset in WHIP, but regardless of his performance he has been a monster in the strikeout department. He should easily eclipse double digit strikeouts during his upcoming two-start week and pitching for the Padres he has a good shot at earning a victory every time he takes the mound. Fantasy managers surely understand what they\u2019re getting from Cease by now and as long as you can stand the potential hit in ERA, he should be started in all leagues.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChase Burns , Reds, RHP (vs. Dodgers, vs. Braves)\\nThe 22-year-old rookie right-hander has been knocked around in his first five starts at the big league level \u2013 posting a 6.65 ERA and 1.62 WHIP over 21 2/3 innings. The one thing that he has been able to do though, is pile up strikeouts with 35 through his first five starts. It\u2019s not going to get any easier for him this week, as he\u2019ll have to take on the Dodgers in the bandbox known as Great American Ballpark before taking on the Braves in the MLB Speedway Classic in Bristol, Tennessee. If all you care about his strikeouts and can handle the ratio risk, then by all means take a shot on Burns this week. Otherwise, you may want to steer clear.\\nBradley Blalock , Rockies, RHP (@ Guardians, vs. Pirates)\\nIt\u2019s easy to say that we should avoid all Rockies\u2019 starting pitchers for their two-start weeks and in practice it makes a lot of sense. I\u2019d love to be able to find a reason to recommend an intriguing young right-hander with matchups on tap against the Guardians on the road and the light-hitting Pirates at Coors Field, but Blalock has struggled to a miserable 8.67 ERA and 1.78 WHIP over 27 innings so far this season while recording a pitiful total of only nine strikeouts. He should be avoided in all leagues.\\nAndre Pallante , Cardinals, RHP (vs. Marlins, @ Padres)\\nPallante is the type of arm that always seems to be available if you\u2019re willing to roll the dice for his two-start weeks. He has been very unimpressive this season, with a 4.91 ERA, 1.37 WHIP and just 72 strikeouts over 110 innings on the year. He\u2019s probably not going to be an asset in ratios this week. What you\u2019re gambling on, is whether or not you think he can beat the Marlins. If he does, he\u2019ll probably deliver favorable results for the week. If not, he\u2019ll end up hurting your squad. Once again, it all depends on your level of risk tolerance.\\nBrad Lord , Nationals, RHP (@ Astros, vs. Brewers)\\nLord has done a decent job bouncing back and forth between the Nationals\u2019 bullpen and their starting rotation, but that doesn\u2019t mean we should be firing him for a difficult two-start week against the Astros and Brewers. He\u2019s still in the process of getting stretched back out and only threw 50 pitches over four innings his last time out. The upside doesn\u2019t justify the risk here.\\n        Published: Fri, 25 Jul 2025 18:22:26 +0000\\n        Source: NBC Sports\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Some things to be excited about as Yankees take on Phillies\\n        Description: Aaron Nola is making rehab progress with a bullpen session and Bryson Stott had quite an exciting day when he and his wife welcomed their newborn son.\\n        Link: https://www.nbcsportsphiladelphia.com/mlb/philadelphia-phillies/phillies-notes-new-york-yankees-vs-philadelphia-phillies-aaron-nola-bryson-stott/676555/?partner=yahoo\\n        Content: Some things to be excited about as Yankees take on Phillies originally appeared on NBC Sports Philadelphia\\nNEW YORK \u2013 We have all become accustomed to the monotone approach Phillies manager Rob Thomson takes when talking about his team. Try to figure out whether his team won a great game or lost an excruciating one, his demeanor certainly won\u2019t be a hint as to which it was.\\nWhen the subject of pitcher Aaron Nola and his current rehabilitation comes up, however, there is a bit \u2013 just a bit \u2013 of excitement that seems to invade the inflection of his voice. Friday before the Phillies took on the New York Yankees, Nola pitched a bullpen session that, by all accounts, have him right where the team wants him to be as he makes his way back from a right ankle sprain and a stress fracture in his right rib cage that has had him sidelined since May 14.\\n\u201cGreat,\u201d Thomson said of Nola\u2019s session at Yankee Stadium. \u201cThree ups, 56 pitches and his command was excellent. To me it looks like he\u2019s ready for an assignment.\u201d\\nThough the rotation seems a bit crowded with the possibility of Mick Abel coming back up and after Andrew Painter threw a very good game Thursday at Lehigh Valley where he allowed just one hit and two earned runs in six innings. But Thomson is quick to point out that Nola could be a huge benefit going down the stretch.\\n\u201cWhen he\u2019s on he\u2019s one of the best pitchers in the game. That\u2019s what you want,\u201d Thomson said.\\n\u201cNo pain in the ankle or rib,\u201d Nola said. \u201cEverything felt normal and I think I\u2019m ready to go out and pitch at Lehigh in game situation.\\nI\u2019m trying to sharpen the delivery still and keep that sharp and keep my pitches sharp, focus on the command on all of them. First inning felt so-so today and once I started throwing more and got stretched, I felt a lot better.\\n\u201cI want to get back for sure,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s tough not pitching. It\u2019s been a little while. It\u2019s what I\u2019m used to doing and going out there every five days and taking the ball for this team. Not being able to do it for this long has been tough. But I\u2019ve learned some things during this rehab process . I\u2019ve tried to educate myself as much as I can on the injuries I\u2019ve had. I\u2019m trying to keep my body strong from here on out. I\u2019m excited to go to Lehigh and pitch a couple games and finally get in game situations.\u201d\\nThomson wasn\u2019t sure if Nola will throw another bullpen before pitching for Lehigh. No matter, the plan is pretty laid out. \u201cI\u2019d like to see him get to at least 90 pitches,\u201d Thomson said. \u201cSo the first time out will probably be the same as it was today, 55 to 60 pitches. And then we\u2019ll graduate him 15 pitches per outing to get him to 90. Whatever that math is.\u201d\\nDaddy done good\\nWith barely any sleep, an addition to the family (newborn son) and long batting slump hanging on his shoulders, second baseman Bryson Stott had a lot going on Wednesday when the team took on the Boston Red Sox.\\nHe responded, in a big way, by going 2-for-4 with a double and a home run. He also scored a pair. While daddy power was a subject with Stott, there are also some more technical things going on with his swing that may be turning his slump around.\\n\u201cWe had him so early and all the tests and everything we\u2019re done, like, by 8, 8:30. We were kind of just sitting around,\u201d said Stott of the birth of his second child. \u201cMy daughter was home with my mom and sister. She said \u2018we\u2019re just going to be sitting here so maybe you should go. I\u2019ll be fine.\u2019 I said \u2018are you sure?\u2019 It was all good. Had the baby around 3:40ish, probably was up till around five or so and got up around eight. I took some naps throughout the day. Felt good, good enough to go. A lot of new adrenaline with a new baby. The tiredness didn\u2019t really hit me till the off day.\\n\u201cLooking back at 2023 and the beginning of 2024, just kind of where my hands were. Trying to get back to, kind of that feeling. I think just the majority of it is timing. I was super early or super late and when you\u2019re too early you fly out to left and when you\u2019re too late you might ground out to short or line out. Just trying to find that balance of just being on time. That fixes a lot of things throughout your swing. I felt on time the last couple days.\u201d\\nStott had been just six for his last 45 heading into Wednesday. Maybe that little, loud thing in his house is just as important as where and how his hands are.\\n\u201cThe last couple of days his swings have looked a lot better,\u201d said Thomson. \u201cHe\u2019s sort of simplified the move. He knows where that barrel\u2019s at. It\u2019s a lot better. He had a lot of waggle in his hands before he made his initial move to get loaded and really was losing his barrel, didn\u2019t know where it was. Now he\u2019s just kind of sitting it on his shoulder and taking it out and it gets going and it\u2019s really simplified his swing.\u201d\\n        Published: Fri, 25 Jul 2025 18:21:43 +0000\\n        Source: NBC Sports Philadelphia\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Mets bolster bullpen with deal for Orioles lefty Gregory Soto ahead of trade deadline\\n        Description: The Mets are sending right-handed pitchers Wellington Aracena and Cameron Foster for the two-time All-Star.\\n        Link: https://www.nbcsports.com/mlb/news/mets-bolster-bullpen-with-deal-for-orioles-lefty-gregory-soto-ahead-of-trade-deadline\\n        Content: FLUSHING, N.Y. \u2014 The New York Mets have acquired help for their bullpen, trading for left-handed reliever Gregory Soto from the Baltimore Orioles for a pair of minor league pitchers.\\n\\nThe Mets announced the trade Friday.

A 2024 NL All-Star, he's in the fourth year of six-year, $70 million deal signed in 2022. He has a $12 million base salary this season and is due $16 million in both 2026 and 2027.\\n\\nWhile McMahon has shown pop at Coors Field, his hitting away from Colorado has been a different story. The new Yankees third baseman has a career batting average of .216 and career OPS of .665 on the road, compared to .263 and .821 at home. He has hit .146 in 41 at-bats with one home run and six RBI in his career at Yankee Stadium.\\nThe Yankees had been seeking help on the left side of their infield, with D.J. LeMahieu designated for assignment earlier this month and Oswald Peraza and Jorbit Vivas struggling to chip in. Arizona Diamondbacks slugger Eugenio Suarez had been rumored as an option, but the two teams were reportedly unable to get close to a deal, according to Jon Heyman.\\nThe Yankees are 56-46 and sit 4.5 games behind the Toronto Blue Jays for first place in the AL East. They've come out of the All-Star break struggling, with a 3-3 record, having just lost two of three to the Blue Jays. They begin a seven-game homestand Friday against the Philadelphia Phillies.\\n\\nFor the Yankees, this is an absolute no-brainer, as predictable as a deadline deal can be. The hot corner has been an abyss of woe in the Bronx for a while now; McMahon fills that need. He\u2019s no superstar, but that\u2019s fine; the Yanks just needed a capable humanoid at third. It\u2019s a glove-over-bat profile because while McMahon makes a ton of hard contact, he\u2019s immensely whiff- and strikeout-prone. Perhaps that changes now that he\u2019s free of Coors Field and all its wonkiness.\\nFor the Rockies, this qualifies as a shocker. Despite the franchise\u2019s sustained run of non-competitiveness, they\u2019ve been incredibly averse to trading away players they view as cornerstones. For other teams, completing trades of any kind with the purple mystery in the mountains is considered quite a chore. Perhaps this trade is a sign that Colorado, jolted awake by its historically bad 2025, is pivoting from those isolationist ways. Perhaps they just really liked Herring and Grosz. \u2014 Mintz\\n        Published: Fri, 25 Jul 2025 17:51:16 +0000\\n        Source: Yahoo Sports\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Yankees acquire 3B Ryan McMahon in trade with Rockies\\n        Description: The Yankees are making an upgrade at third base, acquiring Ryan McMahon from the Colorado Rockies.\\n        Link: https://sny.tv/articles/yankees-ryan-mcmahon-trade-rockies-7-25-25\\n        Content: The Yankees are making an upgrade at third base, acquiring Ryan McMahon from the Colorado Rockies.\\nNew York is sending two pitching prospects in exchange for the 2024 All-Star, LHP Griffin Herring and RHP Josh Grosz . MLB.com's Mark Feinsand was the first to report the trade.\\nThe Rockies are currently a league-worst 26-76 and on pace for the worst record in major league history.\\nMcMahon is in the fourth year of a six-year, $70 million contract. He's owed $16 million each of the next two seasons before becoming a free agent ahead of the 2028 season.\\nThe 30-year-old is slashing .217/.314/.403 this season with 16 home runs, 15 doubles, and 35 RBI over 100 games. He's struck out a league-leading 127 times, but is still on pace for his fifth straight 20-plus home run season, and the sixth of his career.\\nIt's a drop-off from his All-Star 2024 season in which he hit .242 with 20 homers, 28 doubles, and 65 RBI. McMahon had a career-best 4.0 WAR in 2021 with 23 home runs, 32 doubles, and 86 RBI in 151 games.\\n\\\"Really excited,\\\" manager Aaron Boone said pregame. \\\"Been an All-Star third baseman, really good defender. Has had some ups and downs offensively this year, I know over the last month he's been swinging the bat well. He's a presence and can really defend over there at third, and has for a number of years. We're excited to get him.\\\"\\nHe later added: \\\"I know there's real offensive potential there... The handful of times that we've played against them that I watch him, you're like, 'That's what it should look like over there.' He moves really well and has that prototypical good third base thing.\\\"\\nMcMahon was drafted by Colorado in the second round of the 2013 MLB Draft out of Mater Dei HS in Santa Ana, CA and made his debut at age 22 in 2017. Over nine seasons and 1,010 games with the Rockies, McMahon owns a .240 batting average and .743 OPS with 140 homers and 452 RBI.\\nDefensively, McMahon has logged 696 games at third base, owning a .968 fielding percentage. He's also played 244 games at second base, 70 at first base, seven as a DH, and two at SS. He's played 100 games at third this season (.978 fielding percentage) and manned the hot corner for 152 games in 2024, leading the league in both assists (323) and errors (15).\\nThe Yankees will bank on his glove at third base for at least the rest of the season, allowing them to slide Jazz Chisholm Jr. back over to second base full-time. This move also likely takes New York out of the running in the Eugenio Suarez sweepstakes. Either way, Boone believes the addition of McMahon will help the team defensively.\\n\\\"I expect, and it needs to be one of our strengths, now bringing in a McMahon and with Anthony [ Volpe ], we need them to play the way they're capable of playing and how we expect them to play. If they do, that becomes a strength.

That stands out from the rest.\\\"\\nIt likely wasn\u2019t an easy battle to come out on top of either, as Wiltfong also reported that the Georgia Bulldogs, the Michigan Wolverines, the Ohio State Buckeyes and the Penn State Nittany Lions were among the quarterback\u2019s other finalists.\\n\\n\\nJarrard also becomes just the third player that Notre Dame and Freeman have landed in the 2027 class , joining three-star linebacker Ellis McGaskin and unrated long snapper Sean Kraft, both of whom committed in June.\\nRelated: Paul Finebaum Didn't Hesitate to Name the Best Player in College Football\\nThis story was originally reported by Athlon Sports on Jul 24, 2025, where it first appeared.\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 21:31:39 +0000\\n        Source: Athlon Sports\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Paul Finebaum praises Moore\u2019s words but doubts Michigan\u2019s CFP bid with Underwood at QB\\n        Description: Paul Finebaum and Harry Douglas debate Michigan\u2019s 2025 rebound with QB Underwood.

Though expected to be ranked in the polls entering 2025, a lot are saying that the schedule is too hard (there's only one team on it that was a College Football Playoff team last year, and Michigan beat them), or that there's too much to fix.\\nBut, as some who are looking at the situation more closely following the Wolverines ' 8-5 season think there's a chance for a decent rebound.\\nAppearing on ESPN's Get Up on Friday , Paul Finebaum and Harry Douglas both shared their thoughts on Sherrone Moore and the maize and blue, with Finebaum initially reacting to Moore's Big Ten media days comments where he said, 'don't let a speed bump become a roadblock.'\\n\\\"I like what he said there. It's hard to find a criticism of a coach who ended the season beating your biggest rival and then beating Alabama in a bowl game with almost no starters as a double-digit (underdog),\\\" Finebaum said. \\\"Sherrone Moore is saying the right things. My question is, does he have the right stuff as a head coach? He did a nice job filling in for Jim Harbaugh during all of the controversy. But he didn't show anyone much last year other than at the very end. He's gotta be more consistent. He does only the best quarterback coming into college football this year in Bryce Underwood. How long will Bryce Underwood take to matriculate? And if he can get him going quickly, they have a chance for a CFP bid, but I don't think they're going to make it. I think they'll fall just short.\\\"\\nDouglas agrees with most of Finebaum's assessment, but thinks that just by having Underwood under center, if he is named the starter as expected, that will fix a lot of ills given the problems Michigan had a year ago.\\n\\\"They're gonna be better because the speed bump in 2024 was the quarterback position,\\\" Douglas said. \\\"There's three games that I have circled: it's the Oklahoma game when they go to Oklahoma, it's the Nebraska game, and it's the Ohio State game. If they can go 2-1 in those games, those three games that I just mentioned, they have an opportunity to make the College Football Playoff because their schedule isn't hard.\\\"\\nFans will get an opportunity to see the new-look Wolverines on August 30 when they host New Mexico for the 2025 season opener at The Big House.\\nThis article originally appeared on Wolverines Wire: Paul Finebaum says Michigan CFP chances rely on Bryce Underwood\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 21:27:48 +0000\\n        Source: Wolverines Wire\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Sherrone Moore and Chip Lindsey aim for balanced, dynamic Michigan offense in 2025 season\\n        Description: Michigan's new offense under Chip Lindsey promises balance and surprises, debuting vs. New Mexico.\\n        Link: https://wolverineswire.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/wolverines/football/2025/07/26/michigan-football-new-offense-chip-lindsey-sherrone-moore-2025/85390302007/\\n        Content: Michigan football fans got a small preview of what the new-look offense might be in the spring game, but not fully. The team was in a split-squad, but not in an A offense vs. B defense sort of way, as the teams were selected via draft. So what Chip Lindsey brings to the table as the Wolverines ' new offensive coordinator remains to be seen.\\nWhat will be interesting is how he meshes with head coach Sherrone Moore's vision. As the former offensive coordinator for the maize and blue himself, Moore's offense was smashmouth, and there's no indication that that will change overall. In fact, as Moore said at Big Ten media days, while 'SMASH!' is the primary directive of that side of the ball, there was a lot more capability we didn't see, situationally -- but this year it might be different.\\n\\\"I think where me and Chip are really similar is just he wanted to do the best for what\u2019s best for our offense, what\u2019s best for our players,\\\" Moore said. \\\"And even when I was calling offenses it wasn\u2019t about like I wanted to just -- people say, 'Oh, we just wanted to run the football.' That\u2019s not really true. There\u2019s times we did, but I wanted to be balanced. Sometimes that balance got out of whack because either I got mad or we wanted to set a tone, and we did that, but it\u2019s really about balance.\\n\\\"And people say we didn\u2019t throw the ball. J.J. McCarthy was quarterback of the year in the Big Ten, as voted by the coaches. So you can\u2019t say that we can\u2019t throw the ball when the quarterback is the quarterback of the year. So I really feel strongly that it\u2019s all about balance and he wants that.\\\"\\nAs Moore notes, it's all about balance, but balance doesn't mean equal reps of run and pass or even equal outcomes. But it is about setting the expectation, having prolific production from multiple positions, and keeping a defense off-kilter.\\nAnd that's something that Lindsey is familiar with.\\n\\\"He\u2019s been a guy that\u2019s had a 1,000-yard rusher, had a 3,000-yard passer,\\\" Moore said. \\\"Fun stat about Chip, he was the offense coordinator at Southern Miss that had 2,000 yard rushers and a 3,000 and a 4,000-yard passer, and I was at Louisville at that time and had like a 1,000 yard rusher and 3,000 yard (passer). So he understands football, he understands the game.\\n\\\"Where we\u2019re different, I don\u2019t know. There\u2019s a lot of different things -- we think about different plays differently. Not necessarily total philosophy, but Chip\u2019s not like a, 'Hey, I just want to be an up-tempo, spread guy.' He\u2019s a balanced guy and does whatever\u2019s best for your program and team. We\u2019ll have those elements in the game. We\u2019ll be able to do things like that, but we\u2019ve always had that. We just chose not to do it as much, where we might, where we might not. I think that all depends on the situation in the game.\\\"\\nFans will get their first opportunity to see the new-look Michigan football offense on August 30 when the Wolverines host New Mexico for the 2025 season opener.\\nThis article originally appeared on Wolverines Wire: Michigan's new offense blends smashmouth with balanced attack\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 21:09:26 +0000\\n        Source: Wolverines Wire\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: James Franklin Doesn't Hold Back on Displeasure With Big Ten Media Days\\n        Description: The Big Ten has expanded its national profile in recent years with the additions of four former Pac-12 teams in USC, UCLA, Washington and Oregon, giving the league a television footprint from coast-to-coast.

They were able to close out the season with a huge upset victory on the road against the arch-rival Ohio State Buckeyes, but the season did not go as planned.\\nMoore and company have put in a lot of work for the 2025 season. Bryce Underwood is set to take the field at quarterback and should give the Michigan offense a huge lift.\\nWith that being said, Moore has spoken out with a blunt warning for the rest of college football.\\nAs shared by Alejandro Zuniga of 247 Sports , Moore spoke out with a seven-word message.\\n\\\"We're ready to put on a show,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\nThose are strong words. Fans simply want to see improvement.\\nJust two years ago under former head coach Jim Harbaugh, the Wolverines won a national championship. Going from a championship to an 8-5 season was an eye-opening reality check. Michigan feels confident that it can get back to contending in the Big Ten.\\nWhether or not that will actually happen will be seen in the near future. Fans are excited to welcome football back, but the work is just beginning.

And you go, 'No, he doesn\u2019t roll. You throw him. You know what I mean? And they\u2019re made for throwing.' And then after a while, they start talking, and they go, 'Well, you know what? I think, if you start talking, they may think they know we\u2019re making fun of them. The midgets may think we\u2019re making fun of them.\u00a0They may get mad at us.'\\n\\\"And then the guys go, 'Well, what we need to do is make them think they\u2019re one of us.' And they go, 'One of us. One of us.' And I think that\u2019s the thing with coaching, call it recruiting\u2026 They talk about requiring players, getting rid of players, just like that. And the whole thing underneath all that is they make them think they\u2019re one of us, you know what I mean? But, I don\u2019t know. Do you have to do that to win?

So, just proud of him, and we just need him to you know, stay focused week in and week out, continue to be the leader that he\u2019s been\u2026 That's where it all starts is trying to you know win your league, you know, be the champion of this league. He's done that twice now, and if he does that again this year, then he'll have an opportunity to prove it on a bigger stage.\u201d\\n\\n\\nKlubnik did have his best season at the collegiate level in 2024, completing 308-of-486 passes for 3,639 yards, 36 touchdowns and six interceptions, while also showing off some dual-threat ability with 463 rushing yards and seven touchdowns.\\nEven though those numbers were solid, it was far from a Heisman Trophy stat line, as he received zero votes , so if Klubnik wants to be the first player for Clemson to bring home the award in program history, he will need to seriously improve.\\nLeading the Tigers to a second straight ACC title would certainly help his case and as of now, that's the expectation, with ESPN BET giving them the best odds (+110) to win the conference.\\nIf they did come out on top, it would propel Clemson into the College Football Playoff, where the race for their first national championship win since 2018 and third under Swinney would officially be on.\\nIt's certainly a tough road ahead, though, as Klubnik's Heisman aspirations will be tested early on with a Week 1 matchup against the LSU Tigers, who are looking to compete for their own conference title within the SEC.\\nRelated: Colorado Reacts to Travis Hunter Earning Huge Honor During Jaguars Training Camp\\nThis story was originally reported by Athlon Sports on Jul 24, 2025, where it first appeared.\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 20:03:26 +0000\\n        Source: Athlon Sports\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Deion Sanders lands on list of college football coaches with most to prove in 2025\\n        Description: Fox Sports named Deion Sanders one of 2025's most pressured coaches as he enters his third season at the helm of Colorado.\\n        Link: https://coloradobuffaloeswire.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/buffaloes/football/2025/07/26/deion-sanders-college-football-coach-pressure-ranking-2025/85388810007/\\n        Content: Colorado Buffaloes head coach Deion Sanders was included on Fox Sports' list of the 10 college football head coaches with the most to prove entering the 2025 season.\\nSanders, who took over Colorado after the 2022 season, landed at No. 9 on the ranking. Penn State's James Franklin took the top spot, followed by USC's Lincoln Riley (No. 2), Oklahoma's Brent Venables (No. 3), Miami's Mario Cristobal (No. 4) and Nebraska's Matt Rhule (No. 5). Wisconsin's Luke Fickell (No. 6), Florida State's Mike Norvell (No. 7), LSU's Brian Kelly (No. 8) and Alabama's Kalen Deboer (No. 10) rounded out the list.\\nSanders' inclusion on the list is not surprising, considering the 2025 season marks his first year coaching without Shedeur Sanders and Travis Hunter. Many people are unsure what to expect from the Buffaloes, given the significant roster turnover this offseason.\\n\\nWhich coach do you think has the most to prove entering this season? pic.twitter.com/DSt9aXk4x5\\n\\nSanders is 13-12 since becoming Colorado's head coach, and after a 9-4 season last year, perhaps he has even more to prove this upcoming season. He doesn't have the national title expectations that many on Fox Sports' list do, but he must show that he can win consistently without Shedeur and Travis.\\nColorado's 2025 schedule is no walk in the park. They face Iowa State , BYU, Utah, TCU, Kansas State and Arizona State , all of which could win the conference title.

With that talent comes major expectations, pressure from fans and media, and talk of a national title run. Franklin isn't shying away from addressing it.\\nThe head coach knows the pressures that come with leading an elite program, especially in Happy Valley as part of the Big Ten. As preseason camp gets underway, Franklin met with the media during Big Ten Media Day and didn\u2019t sugarcoat his message about the national title buzz.\\n\u201cA lot of people worked really hard to put ourselves in this position,\u201d Franklin said.\\nThen came the real message from Franklin.\\n\u201cNo one gives a [expletive] about preseason rankings.\u201d\\n\\n\\nThe Nittany Lions won their first seven games of the 2024 season. Their only regular season loss came on Nov. 2 in a 20-13 home defeat to Ohio State. Penn State bounced back with four straight wins to earn a spot in the Big Ten title game.\\nThere, Franklin's squad came up short in a 45-37 shootout against Oregon in Indianapolis. Despite the loss, their full-season r\u00e9sum\u00e9 was strong enough to earn a College Football Playoff berth.\\nPenn State made the most of the opportunity, blowing out SMU 38-10 in their first playoff game, then defeating Boise State 31-14 in Glendale, Arizona.\\nIn the CFP semifinal, the Nittany Lions lost to Notre Dame 27-24 on a late field goal. Franklin noted they were one drive away from reaching the final.\\nLooking ahead to this season, ESPN's College Football Power Index ranked Penn State fifth behind Texas, Georgia, Alabama and Ohio State. The Nittany Lions were given a 7% chance to win out and claim the College Football Playoff title.\\nFranklin returns a solid core from last year\u2019s team. Quarterback Drew Allar leads the group, entering his fourth season with 29 career starts. In 2024, he threw for 3,327 yards and 24 touchdowns. Running back Nicholas Singleton is also back for his senior season, having scored 32 rushing touchdowns and eight receiving TDs across his first three seasons.\\nPenn State\u2019s projected starting receivers are all transfers. Kyron Hudson, Devonte Ross and Trebor Pena are expected to make up the starting trio and bring new energy to the offense.\\nThe Nittany Lions open the 2025 season at home on Aug. 30 against Nevada.\\nRelated: Jeremiah Smith Announces Major NIL Deal After Freshman Season at Ohio State\\nRelated: Kirby Smart Wins Recruiting Battle for 4-Star Cornerback\\nThis story was originally reported by Athlon Sports on Jul 24, 2025, where it first appeared.\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 20:01:23 +0000\\n        Source: Athlon Sports\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Florida Trending for Prospect Tabbed Next Freshman Phenom\\n        Description: It would be a major get for the Gators.\\n        Link: https://athlonsports.com/college/florida-gators/florida-trending-for-prospect-tabbed-next-freshman-phenom\\n        Content: Florida Trending for Prospect Tabbed Next Freshman Phenom originally appeared on Athlon Sports .\\nThe Florida Gators are in the hunt for a very intriguing college football prospect from the 2028 class.\\nSocial media blew up last weekend after a crazy one-handed catch was made at the NFL Flag Championships by receiver Brysen Wright. The original video of Wright's snag has over 7 million views and caught the eye of NFL talent like Patrick Mahomes, Caleb Williams, and others.\\nOn3's Adam Gorney caught up with Wright to discuss recruiting and which schools are currently in the lead. Wright revealed he has heard from the Gators, Ohio State Buckeyes and Miami Hurricanes.\\n\\n\\n\u201cThe only (main) schools I\u2019m hearing from now really are\u00a0Ohio State,\u00a0Florida\u00a0and\u00a0Miami,\u201d\\nGorney compared Wright to sophomore Ohio State receiver Jeremiah Smith. Smith burst onto the scene last season, leading the Buckeyes with 1,315 receiving yards as a true freshman.\\nSmith was a former five-star prospect and the top receiver in the 2024 class. Wright is rated as a four-star on Rivals, and On3's Hayes Fawcett believes the recruit will be one of the prospects in the class.\\nWright is familiar with Florida, as the Gators had him in town for an unofficial visit in November of last year. The On3 Recruiting Prediction Machine has tabbed Florida as the favorite and gives it a 21.9% chance to land him.\\nOhio State has a 13.7% chance, while Miami has a 1.2% chance.\\nWhile Wright's decision may not be imminent, Florida is trending upward as a program. The Gators just secured the first winning season of head coach Billy Napier's tenure, and people are paying close attention to Florida.\\nGreg McElroy even said that Florida could be a problem with a consistent running game.\\nIf Wright pans out as people expect, it would be a massive addition to Florida.\\nRelated: Florida Has College Football Playoff Odds Revealed\\nThis story was originally reported by Athlon Sports on Jul 24, 2025, where it first appeared.\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 20:00:45 +0000\\n        Source: Athlon Sports\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: DYNAMIC DUO: New Tahlequah defensive coordinators look at taking over position\\n        Description: Two is better than one, and Tahlequah football is embracing that mentally with their defensive coordinator for 2025.

Ryals has worn many hats on the defensive side of the ball, most recently serving as inside linebackers coach for the 2022-\u201924 seasons.\\nThe new DCs aren\u2019t expecting to change much on defense. For the most part, THS\u2019 defense will look like it has in years past, with some changes coming on a game-to-game basis.\\nRyals mug\\nCody Ryals\\n\u201cIt\u2019s par for the course; I was with [Wilson] forever and you can talk about the X\u2019s and O\u2019s that all the coaches do.

I appreciate their loyalty. They\u2019ve been with us for as many years as they have, and they\u2019ve just been loyal to the program. They care about these young men.\u201d\\nIchniowski has been with the program for 14 seasons but wasn\u2019t originally on the defensive side of the ball. When Wilson came in, Ichniowski moved to defense in a group he enjoys in the linebackers.\\nStepping into the DC position has changed how Ichniowski views the game.\\n\u201cI have to have a much bigger picture in my mind of what\u2019s going on,\u201d Ichniowski said. \u201cI have been more involved in what our overall goals should be and what our defense needs to accomplish. That\u2019s everything from player positions to what kind of coverages we run against certain offensive schemes.\u201d\\nIn previous seasons, the duo had input on the plays THS was running, but now they have the game-time decision making.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s a different set of responsibilities, a different mindset,\u201d Ichniowski said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of the same stuff; once we get into the season, it will be a little different as far as calling plays and being more involved in the scouting, practice planning and stuff like that.\u201d\\nThe Tigers\u2019 defense looks like it will be very solid, with key players returning in every position.\\nTraeven Morrison is one of four returning starting linebackers. Synjin Sampson highlights the safeties for the Tigers, and Elvis Myers and Kingston Hall headline the defensive rushing attack. There is returning talent from top to bottom with the Tigers\u2019 defense, and the DC duo sees a chance for a strong unit.\\n\u201cWe returned the entire linebacker corps,\u201d Ryals said. \u201cWe return a bunch of production from those guys. It\u2019s all about them; they are the ones who go out there and play on Friday nights.

While Commissioner Greg Sankey has said on multiple occasions that the conference is content with its current 16 schools, that doesn't mean programs aren't interested in joining the conference responsible for producing 14 champions since 2000.\\nEarlier this week, Inside Carolina's Adam Smith reported that the North Carolina Tar Heels are eying a move to the SEC.\\n\\\"But make no mistake, now, multiple sources told IC, the SEC is where the Tar Heels are aiming under the leadership of Roberts and Newmark, should UNC move to leave the ACC for another league, perhaps in the near future,\\\" wrote Smith. \\\"Sources said the 2030-31 school year, when the ACC's decreasing exit fees dip from $93 million to the flat $75 million threshold, would figure to become an important final line of demarcation, if the Tar Heels haven't made their departure sooner.\\\"\\n\\n\\nAs confirmed by Smith, if the Tar Heels were to attempt to leave the ACC any year before 2030, the exit fees would range from $93 million to $165 million. The fees drop to $75 million from 2030-36.\\nWhile both Florida State and Clemson have essentially attempted to kick and scream their way into an SEC invite, Scott Dochterman of The Athletic revealed North Carolina's biggest advantage.\\nAside from Charlotte being the location of the SEC Network's headquarters, there are also no teams in either the SEC or Big Ten in the state.\\nThere is still plenty of time for the ACC to find a fix that keeps everyone happy, but North Carolina is sitting pretty regardless.\\nRelated: Greg McElroy Names Team to Beat in SEC Without Hesitation\\nThis story was originally reported by Athlon Sports on Jul 24, 2025, where it first appeared.\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 19:35:07 +0000\\n        Source: Athlon Sports\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Steve Sarkisian Compares Jeremiah Smith To Legendary NFL WR Before Ohio State Clash\\n        Description: Sarkisian's bold comp for Jeremiah Smith.\\n        Link: https://athlonsports.com/college/texas-longhorns/steve-sarkisian-compares-jeremiah-smith-to-legendary-nfl-wr-before-ohio-state-clash\\n        Content: Steve Sarkisian Compares Jeremiah Smith To Legendary NFL WR Before Ohio State Clash originally appeared on Athlon Sports .\\nWhen the Texas Longhorns and defending national champion Ohio State Buckeyes meet in a season\u2011opening showdown at Ohio Stadium on Aug. 30, it will mark only the fifth meeting in a series that is deadlocked at 2-2.\\nTheir most recent clash came in the College Football Playoff semifinal at the Cotton Bowl Classic on Jan. 10, when the Buckeyes pulled away for a 28-14 victory.\\nThis season, the man drawing the most attention in Columbus is Ohio State sophomore wide receiver Jeremiah Smith.\\nOn Thursday, Texas head coach Steve Sarkisian spoke with Colin Cowherd about how to contain a player of Smith\u2019s caliber, using comparisons to a former NFL superstar.\\n\\\"I had a chance to coach Julio Jones for two years in Atlanta. He reminds me a lot of him \u2014 big and physical, but yet fast.

Heading into the 2025 season, the Nittany Lions return four out of five starters, a level of continuity that\u2019s rare in college football. This group is experienced, physical, and finally built to push around elite defenses.\\nWhen you have that kind of chemistry in the trenches, everything else opens up. The quarterbacks stay clean and the running backs find lanes. The whole offense breathes easier. For a team that wants to make a legit playoff run once again, having a veteran line is exactly the foundation you want.\\nDrew Shelton has been tested on the edge and continues to improve every year. Nick Dawkins and Vega Ioane also provide critical depth and flexibility. If injuries hit, the drop-off won\u2019t be major. That\u2019s what makes this line so scary. These aren\u2019t just big bodies; they\u2019re leaders who know how to win in the Big Ten.\\nWhat separates this O-line from past Penn State units is balance. These guys aren\u2019t just built to run block or pass protect, they can do both at a high level. You saw glimpses of it last season when they controlled the line of scrimmage in big games, but now the expectation is domination week to week.\\nIn short-yardage situations, this group can lean on people. In passing situations, they can give Drew Allar the time he needs to go through his reads and take deep shots. There\u2019s no glaring weakness. Every guy on this line plays with an edge, and they\u2019ve been through enough together to trust each other when the pressure hits.\\nIf Penn State\u2019s offensive line stays healthy and plays to its potential, this team can absolutely win the Big Ten and make a push for the College Football Playoff. Success for this unit means keeping Drew Allar clean, helping Nicholas Singleton and Kaytron Allen hit 1,000 yards again , and setting the tone every Saturday.\\nA disappointing year would mean inconsistent protection, missed blocks in key moments, or lack of push in short-yardage. But right now, everything is pointing in the opposite direction.\\nThis offensive line isn\u2019t flashy and that\u2019s exactly why it works. It\u2019s built to dominate in silence and take Penn State where it\u2019s trying to go.\\nThis article originally appeared on Nittany Lions Wire: Veteran offensive line could be key to Penn State\u2019s 2025 playoff hopes\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 19:00:36 +0000\\n        Source: Nittany Lions Wire\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Ranking the Top 25 players to play for Alabama in the last 25 years\\n        Description: Alabama has seen some all-time greats play in Tuscaloosa over the last 25 years.

Richardson, a two-time national champion, had likely his best season at Alabama in 2011 where he led the SEC with 1,679 yards and 21 touchdowns to win the Doak Walker Award.\\n\\nA four-year impact player in Alabama's backfield, running back Najee Harris racked up a combined 3,843 yards and 46 touchdowns on 638 attempts from 2017-20, while also hauling in 80 receptions for 781 yards and 11 additional scores.

Jones' best season at Alabama was likely his 2010 campaign in which he hauled in 78 receptions for 1,133 yards and seven touchdowns, each of which were career-high's.\\n\\nAlabama's first-ever Heisman Trophy winner, running back Mark Ingram spent three years at Alabama from 2008-10 where he racked up a combined 3,261 yards and 42 touchdowns on 572 attempts, while also hauling in 60 catches for 670 yards and four more scores.

This past week, Big Ten media days unfolded in Las Vegas, kicking off the year for the sport's biggest conference.\\nIn a recent story , ESPN's Bill Connelly gave a detailed 2025 outlook for every Big Ten team. Here is what he had to say about USC.\\n\\\"When you've gone just 15-13 in your last 28 games at USC, as Riley has since an 11-1 start, your name is going to automatically show up on \\\"hot seat\\\" lists. That's just the way it works. But damned if Riley isn't building his team like a guy with the best job security in the world. His Trojans' win total has fallen for two straight years, but he signed only 16 transfers, an average number in 2025, and less than half of them are seniors. He elected to stick with junior\u00a0Jayden Maiava\u00a0at quarterback after four solid but unspectacular starts. And despite losing quite a bit of depth from his first semi-competent defense in four years -- only 10 of 13 players with 300-plus snaps return -- he definitely didn't overdo it with portal guys.\\n\\\"Riley reportedly has a pretty prohibitive buyout at the moment, and he's acting like it. Though this team does have a handful of pretty good seniors -- linebacker\u00a0Eric Gentry\u00a0and incoming transfers in running back\u00a0Eli Sanders\u00a0(New Mexico), cornerback\u00a0DJ Harvey\u00a0(San Jos\u00e9 State) and safety\u00a0Bishop Fitzgerald\u00a0(NC State) -- most of this team's best players are guys who will still have eligibility left in 2026, when members of what is currently\u00a0a spectacular recruiting class\u00a0come to town. Steel yourself for some serious USC hype this time next year, I guess.\\n\\\"D'Anton Lynn did a nice job in his first season as defensive coordinator; the Trojans improved from 105th to 48th in defensive SP+, thanks mostly to big-play prevention and outstanding third-down defense. Safety\u00a0Kamari Ramsey\u00a0is the only returning starter in the secondary, but he's great, and Harvey and Fitzgerald should help. Gentry is a good playmaker at linebacker, and the addition of 330-pounder\u00a0Keeshawn Silver\u00a0(Kentucky) and 350-pounder\u00a0Jamaal Jarrett\u00a0(Georgia) up front should certainly provide some, uh, immovability. I don't expect an elite defense, but further improvement is likely.\\n\\\"On offense, Maiava is a decent scrambler, Sanders and juco transfer Waymond Jordan are exciting and explosive additions, and slot receiver\u00a0Makai Lemon\u00a0averaged a whopping 3.0 yards per route, second in the conference.\\n\\\"The line is more experienced, especially with the additions of senior transfers\u00a0J'Onre Reed\u00a0(Syracuse) and\u00a0DJ Wingfield\u00a0(Purdue), but I'm not sure about the upside there. Regardless, Riley should have enough to field another top-20 offense, develop further, win another seven or eight games and buy time for the cavalry to arrive in 2026.\\\"\\nWhile USC fans are certainly not expecting a national championship this season, another year of winning seven or eight games is certainly not what anyone is looking for. Riley and the Trojans will look to prove Connelly's projections wrong on the field this fall.\\nThis article originally appeared on Trojans Wire: What are ESPN's expectations for USC football in 2025\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 18:42:18 +0000\\n        Source: Trojans Wire\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Paul Finebaum isn't buying the hype over marquee Clemson football opponent in 2025\\n        Description: Paul Finebaum is far from sold on one of the biggest opponents on the Clemson Tigers' 2025 football schedule.\\n        Link: https://clemsonwire.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/clemson/football/2025/07/26/bill-belichick-unc-football-paul-finebaum-blasts-legendary-coach/85387660007/\\n        Content: Longtime college football voice Paul Finebaum isn't buying the hype over one ACC program and Clemson opponent on the Tigers' 2025 schedule.\\nAppearing on Friday's episode of \\\"Get Up\\\" on ESPN, Finebaum joined host Mike Greenberg and panelists Harry Douglass, Damien Woody and Mike Tannenbaum to discuss some of the top storylines entering the 2025 college football season.\\nOne of the biggest storylines has been Bill Belichick's return to coaching. Belichick is entering his first season at North Carolina just a year removed from a 24-year run with the New England Patriots that included a record six Super Bowl championships.\\nBut many are skeptical that Belichick, 73, still has it and can win big in college football and at UNC. Finebaum is one such cynic. When asked what the realistic expectations were for Belichick in 2025, Finebaum made his stance clear:\\n\\\"They are very low, Greeny, for this reason: he doesn't have a very good team, although he's in a workable league. I think he can win seven games, maybe steal one to go eight. But ladies and gentlemen, this is not Deion Sanders coming back to college for a couple of obvious reasons. Shedeur Sanders and Travis Hunter, he doesn't have anyone like that. Therefore, the eyes of the nation will be there on opening night, maybe a second and third time, but it's not going to be must-see TV.\\\"\\nFinebaum called the end of Belichick's career with the Patriots a \\\"disaster\\\" and recalled that the coach never won a playoff game over his final four seasons in Foxborough.\\n\\\"He had losing seasons three out of the last five (years),\\\" Finebaum added. \\\"It was a mess at the end. He should have been fired earlier than he was, and this is just him trying to make good. He's trying to impress his girlfriend. He's trying to make some money, and ultimately I don't think it's going to work.\\\"\\nClemson will visit North Carolina and Kenan Memorial Stadium for a matchup against Belichick's Tar Heels on Oct. 4. The Tigers haven't played in Chapel Hill since late September 2019 when they avoided an upset by stopping a 2-point conversion with under two minutes to play, preserving a 21-20 victory.\\nThe Tigers haven't lost to UNC since 2010 and have won the last six meetings in the head-to-head series.\\nAt ACC Kickoff in Charlotte this week, Belichick praised Dabo Swinney and the program he's built at Clemson.\\n\\\"We're all learning from Dabo,\\\" Belichick said from the podium on Thursday and added, \\\"Dabo has been a friend for a long time. We've scouted his players from the NFL down. Some of the players that are here today, I actually thought maybe we'll be drafting one of these guys, and now here we are going to be playing against them.\\n\\\"Dabo has been great. I have so much respect for him and the Clemson program, what he's done, the way he runs it. It's high quality. Kids are high quality. He came up to New England and got probably the top player out of New England in probably the last decade in Christian Wilkins... I think that says a lot for the program that he runs and what he's done for not only college football but all the student-athletes that he's coached there. They've gone on to represent him and the school very well.\\\"\\nFor Swinney, the admiration for Belichick is mutual.\\n\\\"I've got a lot of respect for him,\\\" Swinney said this week in Charlotte. \\\"It's well-documented what he's done as a football coach, but I just think he's a very interesting guy. I love talking to him.\\\"\\n\\nClemson opens the 2025 season against the LSU Tigers at Clemson Memorial Stadium in prime time on Aug. 30. Kickoff is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. ET.

And let Joe and Jamar handle the offense. Almost offload the offense to them.\\\"\\nWright also thinks that if Saban returns, he wouldn\u2019t want a rebuilding job as he would have had to do in Cleveland, which is why the Bengals would make sense.\\n\\\"You handle the details, finding some of the edges in young players from the college game that you're very aware of their skillset, and coach up the defense. Because the only point that you made that I disagree with is, if I'm Nick Saban and I want to do this, I'm not that interested in a studs-to-the-top-down rebuild. I'm much more interested in, I've got three or four years. Let me see if I can have a contender immediately. I think the Bengals who, if they miss the playoffs again, probably will be looking for a new coach. I think they could be an attractive one.\\\"\\nWright makes an interesting and compelling argument for the Bengals than Cowherd did for the Browns.\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 18:31:17 +0000\\n        Source: The Sporting News\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Ranking the SEC\u2019s Top 10 Cornerbacks for the 2025 College Football Season\\n        Description: It should be a strong year for cornerbacks in the SEC.

A shutdown corner can change the completion of a defense. When a defensive coordinator trusts a corner on an island, it makes everything easier for the rest of the unit.\\nSafeties can help in run support, and playcallers can dial up creative blitzes. If another player in the secondary is struggling, resources can be allocated there because the coaches know the shutdown corner doesn't need any help.\\nLSU football fans have become familiar with elite cornerback play over the years. LSU is known as \\\"DBU\\\", even if the Tigers' secondary hasn't been up to standard in recent years. LSU is hoping that changes this year with the addition of some top transfers, along with five-star freshman DJ Pickett.\\nCornerback play around the SEC is expected to be strong with several of the top names from 2024 set to return. With kick-off one month away, here's a look at the SEC's top cornerbacks for the 2025 football season.\\nLee joined Auburn in 2023 as a four-star recruit from Georgia. He saw time as a true freshman, playing 336 snaps, but 2024 was a breakout year for the cornerback. Lee's 58.0 passer rating targeted ranks second among returning SEC corners, only trailing the guy who is No. 1 on this list.\\nLee broke up four passes with two picks and forced seven incompletions. Quarterbacks weren't afraid to throw his direction, but he made them pay. Opposing offenses completed just 46.9% of passes when throwing at Lee.\\nDomani Jackson has a strong case to be higher on this list was named Second Team Preseason All-SEC at SEC Media Days. He has the attention of NFL scouts, and with a strong 2025, he'll be a first-round pick in next year's NFL Draft.\\nJackson is a former five-star recruit who began his career at USC. 2024 was Jackson's first year with the Tide, and he broke up five passes while recording two interceptions. Jackson made 15 stops and had a 63.0 passer rating when targeted.\\nExpect a big year from the talented veteran in 2025.\\nDelane was one of the top available corners in the transfer portal. With LSU needing help in the secondary, the Tigers made Delane a priority and secured his commitment.\\nDelane was Third-Team All-ACC with Virginia Tech in 2024. He posted a 69.5 PFF defensive grade and allowed a completion percentage of 47.2%, which ranked seventh among ACC cornerbacks. Delane is a big and physical corner who will replace Zy Alexander in the boundary.\\nDelane has a knack for forcing turnovers with six career picks and four forced fumbles.\\n\\\"Mansoor Delane has been very, very impactful at the cornerback position,\\\" LSU head coach Brian Kelly said.\\nJackson wasn't the only Alabama corner to make this list -- he's joined by teammate Zabien Brown.\\nBrown made an instant impact as a five-star freshman in 2024. He played 660 snaps and posted a PFF coverage grade of 70.8. Brown's allowed completion percentage of 45% ranks fourth among returning SEC cornerbacks and he allowed a reception once per 18.7 coverage snaps. That's close to an elite mark.\\nNow, as Brown enters his sophomore year, he looks to take another step. If he progresses at this rate, he has a chance to be the best corner in the SEC by season's end.\\nBowen's 78.7 PFF coverage grade ranks second among returning SEC cornerbacks. He was a three-star recruit, but he exceeded all expectations and made a massive impact as a true freshman. Bowen served as a rotational piece early in the year, but took over as a starter in week seven and didn't look back.\\nBowen stands at 5-foot-9, but he punches above his weight and can play on the outside.\\nLSU got the best of Bowen, targeting him for 115 yards. But it's hard to find any blemishes outside of that. Look for Bown to emerge as a star in 2025.\\nDaylen Everette earned First Team Preseason All-SEC honors at media days. The veteran Georgia cornerback has over 1,600 snaps under his belt after three years with the Bulldawgs and now looks to have a career campaign as a senior.\\nEverette has eight career pass breakups with four picks. Three of those picks came in 2024, when Everette posted a 73.3 PFF coverage grade. Everette forced two fumbles and registered a sack, too.\\nGeorgia needs Everette to perform at a superstar level as the Dawgs look to get back to playing national championship-level defense after the unit was down a tick in 2024.\\nLee was one of the top-ranked transfers in last year's transfer class. Texas A&M was searching for an impact corner and got just what it was looking for.\\nLee posted a 71.8 coverage grade and allowed just 47.2% of targets to be completed, which was one of the best marks in the SEC. Standing at 6-foot-3, Lee is one of the most physical corners in the conference. Despite just being in college for two years, Lee has already played 1,000+ snaps of quality football.\\nLee has the upside to be an All-American and a first-round pick in next year's NFL Draft.\\nMuhammad has big shoes to fill. Star Texas corner Jhadae Barron is off to the NFL, leaving Muhammad as the feature piece in the secondary.\\nMuhammad was a highly touted recruit in the class of 2023, just missing the cut to be a five-star. He broke up nine passes in 2024, which is tied for the best mark among returning SEC cornerbacks. He can blanket receivers and opponents only completed 50% of passes when throwing his way.\\nMuhammad has the talent to be an All-American corner. Texas needs Muhammad to play at that level with the departure of Barron.\\nI'm doing some projection here after Crawford's stellar true freshman campaign. But the numbers back it up.\\nCrawford's forced incompletion rate of 28% ranks No. 1 among returning SEC corners. His allowed completion percentage of 40.6% is also the best mark in that group. He only allowed 13 catches all year with 19.1 snaps/reception, ranking second among returning SEC corners.\\nCrawford played just 267 snaps, fewer than most of the guys on this list, but he'll be a full-time starter in 2025. His lone bad game came vs. Texas A&M, where he allowed over 100 yards, but Crawford was near perfect outside of that.\\nI expect Crawford to be All-American in 2025.\\nJermod McCoy transferred to Tennessee ahead of 2024 after a standout freshman campaign with Oregon State in 2023. The adjustment to the SEC was seamless as McCoy emerged as one of the top defenders in the conference.\\nMcCoy broke up six passes and picked off four. McCoy was targeted a lot, 62 times, but he was a playmaker when the ball was thrown his way. He forced 12 incompletions, which was one of the best marks in the SEC.\\nThere's one hang-up here, though. McCoy tore his ACL in January, and there's a chance he's not ready for week one. But that's not enough to keep McCoy out of the top spot. Assuming McCoy's recovery is smooth, he's the best corner in this conference.\\nTennessee's defense was stout in 2024, and while some key pieces are gone, McCoy gives them a chance to be top-notch again in 2025.\\nThis article originally appeared on LSU Wire: Ranking the SEC's top 10 cornerbacks for the 2025 season\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 18:23:19 +0000\\n        Source: LSU Tigers Wire\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Jeremiah Smith Doesn\u2019t Hesitate Naming the \u2018Loudest Stadium\u2019 He\u2019s Ever Played In\\n        Description: The Ohio State Buckeyes are coming off a roller-coaster 2024 season that ended in triumph.

It's a result of the 10 years of success they enjoyed prior to joining the SEC. It's a slate that has some tough road trips and difficult stretches of games. But that's what comes with playing in the SEC . OU will face several challenges, but head coach Brent Venables remains confident in his team ahead of the 2025 season.\\nHowever, not every game is the same, and the teams Oklahoma faces this year have undergone significant turnover from the rosters the Sooners struggled against in 2024. There's an opportunity for OU to have a resurgent season, but they'll need to be on top of their game every single week.\\nFor the Sooners to be in playoff contention, these are the five most important games on their 2025 schedule.\\n\\nTypically, it would be tough to argue that a week two nonconference game holds the most importance in a season. But Oklahoma doesn't simply need to win the game for the record's sake; they need to win it to flip the narrative about the program.\\nIt's an early-season matchup between two iconic brands in primetime. The college football world will be watching.\\nThe Sooners have high expectations for the 2025 season and getting a win over Michigan in week two would provide a ton of confidence for a team looking to re-establish itself as one of the sport's best.\\nThe Texas Longhorns enter the season as the favorites in the SEC. They're among a handful of teams with the best shot to win the national championship. Their Red River Rivals have blown them out in two of Venables' three seasons at the helm. Although there were extenuating circumstances that contributed to Oklahoma's poor offensive performance, it's still a terrible look for the program that invented winning.\\nGoing up against the former five-star quarterback Arch Manning, a talented play-caller in Steve Sarkisian, and one of the best defenses in college football the Sooners will face a significant test when they take on the Longhorns in the Cotton Bowl.\\nThe Red River Showdown doesn't just have on-field implications; it can sway recruiting battles. Perception is often reality, and the perception nationally is that Texas is light years ahead of the Oklahoma Sooners. Whether that's the reality or not, the only way to change that perception is to win the game.\\n\\nThe Oklahoma Sooners held a 14-10 lead midway through the second quarter on the road in Death Valley in 2024. Then the Sooners gave up a 100-yard kickoff return for a touchdown to Anthony Anderson that turned the tide. Including the kick return, the Sooners were outscored 27-3 over the final two and a half quarters.\\nThe Sooners' coverage was exposed by Garrett Nussmeier and Chris Hilton, and the offense couldn't respond.\\nOU will welcome the Tigers to Gaylord-Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium to close out the regular season. This game could have both short-term and long-term ramifications for the future of the program.\\nThe LSU Tigers are expected to be a contender in 2025, and if the Sooners are as good as many think they could be, this game could determine a playoff berth for either team.\\n\\nRight after the Oklahoma Sooners play Arch Manning and the Texas Longhorns in Dallas, the Sooners have to go on the road to face the South Carolina Gamecocks and LaNorris Sellers in Williams-Brice Stadium in South Carolina. Two tough tests against two of the SEC's best quarterbacks and teams in back-to-back weeks.\\nThere isn't a more difficult two-game stretch on the schedule for the Oklahoma Sooners.\\nObviously, Oklahoma wants to win both games, but for them to maintain any playoff aspirations for 2025, they have to come out of this two-game stretch at least 1-1. Lose both and OU would have to run the table over the final five games of the season.\\n\\nThe Oklahoma Sooners pulled off one of the biggest upsets of the season when they beat Alabama 24-3 in Norman last season. The win knocked Alabama out of playoff contention and provided a glimpse of what the Sooners could be along the offensive line when everyone is healthy. The defense was stout, shutting down Jalen Milroe in the run game and picking off a couple of passes that led to scores.\\nAlabama is expected to be a contender this year and you know the Crimson Tide faithful will want to make the Sooners pay for last year's upset.\\nComing out of a bye week, the road trip to Tuscaloosa will kick off a pivotal three-game stretch to close the season against Alabama, Missouri, and LSU.\\nContact/Follow us @SoonersWire on X, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Oklahoma news, notes, and opinions.

The North Cobb (Ga.) High School star picked Notre Dame over Ohio State, Georgia, Penn State and Michigan.\\nThe Irish staff went about recruiting the quarterback position in a unique fashion in the 2027 class, choosing to wait until this summer to offer anyone at the position. When offers did go out the staff offered just two players, with Jarrard being one of the two. It was imperative that Notre Dame land one of those two players, who the staff evaluated as the best fits for the program after months of taking a deep dive into a number of talented quarterbacks. Landing Jarrard gives the Irish one of those two big time prospects and gives the program an elite foundation to build the 2027 class around.\\nThe 6-3, 195-pound quarterback spent his first two seasons of high school at North Cobb (Ga.) Christian, where he passed for 4,712 yards and 49 touchdowns as a two-year starter. Jarrard passed for 2,065 yards as a freshman and then went for 2,647 yards and 31 touchdowns as a sophomore. Jarrard also cut his interceptions down from 11 to 5 in his second season as a starter.\\nJoin the Notre Dame Champions Lounge for the latest intel and analysis of the Fighting Irish!\\nAs the Notre Dame staff began focusing more and more on the 2027 quarterback class a number of players started to emerge. Quarterbacks coach Gino Guidugli spent much of the winter and spring traveling and evaluating players in the class, which included Jarrard. Notre Dame also has him on campus for a workout in early June and throughout the process came away very impressed with his tools and potential as a quarterback. Notre Dame extended a formal offer to Jarrard on June 21st, and the Irish quickly rose to the top of his list.\\nJarrard attended the elite Rivals camp this summer and won top quarterback honors, and there were several Notre Dame commits in attendance as well. By the time that camp was over it appeared the Irish had climbed to the top of the list for Jarrard and in the weeks since Guidugli and the staff were able to convince Jarrard of how well he fits into the program. That pursuit has now ended with Jarrard joining the class, which once again gives Notre Dame a talented quarterback to build the class around.\\nThe North Cobb standout is a four-star recruit that earned a Top 100 grade on the Irish Breakdown board. His sophomore film shows a player with a lot of talent, but his footwork and overall mechanics are still a bit of a work on progress. The potential, however, is outstanding and Jarrard already has a 4.5-star upside grade, which is that of a player that ranks in the Top 50-75. With two years of high school still left there is plenty of time and room for Jarrard to improve, and I expect him to continue climbing up the rankings.\\nOn3/Rivals ranks Jarrard as the No. 52 overall player in the 2027 class and as the No. 2 quarterback in the country.\\nJarrard is the third player to commit to Notre Dame in the 2027 class, joining talented Alabama linebacker Ellis McGaskin and the nation's top snapper in Sean Kraft .\\nOn top of offers from Notre Dame, Ohio State, Georgia, Michigan and Penn State, Jarrard also had scholarship offers from Clemson, Florida State, Miami (Fla.), Auburn, Missouri, Virginia Tech, Wisconsin, Illinois, North Carolina, Arkansas, Indiana, NC State, Syracuse, Mississippi State, Purdue, Boston College, Kentucky, Duke, Minnesota, Virginia, Vanderbilt, Cincinnati and Wake Forest.\\nBe sure to check out the Irish Breakdown message board, the Champions Lounge\\nIrish Breakdown Content\\n2025 Scholarship Chart 2025 Football Schedule\\nNotre Dame 2026 Commits Notre Dame 2026 Scholarship Offers\\n2025 Commit Rankings - Offense 2025 Commit Rankings - Defense\\n2024 Recruiting Class 2023 Recruiting Class 2022 Recruiting Class\\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\\nBecome a premium Irish Breakdown member, which grants you access to all of our premium content and our premium message board!

Well, he\u2019s had to manage your wealth, too,\\\" Swinney said of Klubnik, who has \\\"grown into a great leader of our team.\\\"\\nThe head coach pointed directly to Clemson's industry-leading player retention as proof of his program's unique appeal. While other top programs grapple with mass defections, Clemson consistently keeps its stars, including leading the nation in returning production with 81% overall (86% offense, 75% defense).\\n\\\"We have most of our team back,\\\" Swinney asserted. \\\"These guys can leave anytime they want, but they so they have to choose, first of all, to come, and then they have to choose to stay. And I just think that says a lot about how we put it together on the front end.\\\"\\nSwinney attributes this loyalty to a \\\"purpose-driven\\\" and \\\"relationship-driven\\\" philosophy, rooted in recruiting young men who \\\"really align with our purpose, guys that really value education and want structure and family and accountability.\\\" He insists players choose Clemson not just for football, but for a holistic environment.\\nThis deep-rooted cohesion, combined with last year's taste of glory \u2013 winning the ACC Championship and making a College Football Playoff appearance \u2013 has ignited a powerful fuel for the 2025 campaign. That \\\"glimpse at the top of the mountain,\\\" as Swinney put it, has sent his team back to work with renewed vigor since January.\\nWith \\\"great, great leaders that really, truly care about each other\\\" and a \\\"very clear vision of how they want to finish,\\\" Swinney is confident his experienced, loyal squad is ready to \\\"do the work\\\" necessary to chase a national championship. In a chaotic college football landscape, Dabo Swinney believes Clemson's steadfast culture and veteran leadership are the ultimate competitive advantage.\\nThis story was originally reported by Athlon Sports on Jul 24, 2025, where it first appeared.\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 16:22:55 +0000\\n        Source: Athlon Sports\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: 3 Statistical Goals BYU Should Achieve For Success in 2025\\n        Description: What are some stats BYU should shoot for in order to have a successful 2025 season?\\n        Link: https://www.vanquishthefoe.com/2025/7/26/24473089/3-statistical-goals-byu-football-should-achieve-for-success-in-2025\\n        Content: BYU is set to report to fall camp this  next week. We look at 3 statistical goals the team should aim for.\\n1,000 yards rushing for LJ Martin\\nThis is a big goal. Especially for BYU. Heck, it\u2019s only happened twice since Jamaal Williams did it in 2016, and both times it was one of the greatest running backs in BYU history in Tyler Allgeier. It\u2019s tough to just burden LJ Martin with such an expectation. However, this year, it\u2019s necessary for a few reasons.\\nThe obvious one is the Wasatch Mountain Range-sized question mark at the most important position in the sport of football, quarterback. The running game needs to shoulder more of the load this year to lift the burden off of whoever is behind center. Historically, teams who have a 1,000-yard rusher are able to dictate the tempo of games and keep their team in every ballgame.\\nAnother is that the offensive line should be good again. With the big addition of Andrew Gentry, and a few experienced players switching around, offensive line coach TJ Woods should be able to get a lot out of this unit.\\nHaving a strong rushing attack complemented by a solid defense should give BYU a chance to win every single game on their schedule. A 1,000-yard rusher is a positive symptom of a functioning offense and good offensive line.\\n30+ sacks plus interceptions\\nBYU defensive coordinator Jay Hill is all about creating havoc for opposing offenses. That was on full display in 2024, when the Cougars boasted one of the best defenses in the entire country. It\u2019s not just about limiting yards, it\u2019s about creating more opportunities for BYU\u2019s own offense to score more points. Stealing possessions. Killing opponents\u2019 drives and, consequently, their will.\\nAfter a few seasons of a lackluster pass rush, the Cougars hit their stride in 2024. They notched 20 sacks as a team. Jack Kelley led the way with 5.0 and returns in 2025.\\nWhere the Cougars really separated themselves was getting 22 interceptions. No college football team had more interceptions than BYU in 2024, with only Texas tying them at the top.\\nThat added up to a combined 42 sacks plus interceptions. Getting at least 30 combined sacks and picks seems to be a formula for success. BYU has achieved that three times since 2020, with all three of those seasons ending in double digit wins. The other two years (2022 and 2023) gave BYU a combined record of 13-12.\\nIt seems like BYU being opportunistic and aggressive on defense leads to team success. But interceptions come with a bit of a luck factor. Expecting BYU to lead the nation in interceptions again is unfair. But creating an effective pass rush that makes opposing quarterbacks make poor decisions is a recipe for success.\\n5+ Turnover Margin\\nAlong the same vein as BYU\u2019s defense creating havoc, the offense should also take care of the football. BYU had an elite turnover margin last season, at plus-eight. That ranked 24th-best among the 134 FBS teams in 2024.\\nJake Retzlaff was not a perfect quarterback. At times, he had trouble taking care of the ball. With a change at quarterback coming this season, the Cougars need to focus on avoiding costly turnovers on offense.\\nSince 2020, the Cougars have had a plus-five or better turnover margin three times. And, go figure, it came during the three double-digit win seasons this decade.\\nThe best teams in college football are usually good at avoiding a high number of turnovers while also creating them on defense. BYU did that well last year. Especially with the roster turnover at some key positions, the Cougars will need to duplicate that success in 2025.\\nIf BYU begins to have problems with turnovers on offense, things could get away from the Cougars.\\n\\nMore from vanquishthefoe.com:\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 16:16:54 +0000\\n        Source: SB Nation\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: UTSA QB opens up on former Memphis player sharing playbook in huge college football scandal\\n        Description: &quot;Out of the blue, for whatever reason, [Ra-El] sent me a couple images that were completely irrelevant,&quot; McCown said.\\n        Link: https://nypost.com/2025/07/26/sports/utsa-qb-opens-up-on-former-memphis-player-sharing-playbook-in-huge-college-football-scandal/?utm_source=yahoo&utm_campaign=nypost&utm_medium=referral\\n        Content: UTSA quarterback Owen McCown downplayed any importance of the messages shared with him by ex-Memphis player Tahj Ra-El last season that included parts of the Tigers\u2019 playbook.\\nMcCown told Sports Illustrated he didn\u2019t share the information with teammates or coaches, and that the story, first reported by TigerSportsReport, has been mischaracterized.\\n\u201cOut of the blue, for whatever reason, [Ra-El] sent me a couple images that were completely irrelevant,\u201d McCown said. \u201cIf anybody gets anything, you\u2019re going to look at it, but it was of no help whatsoever to me and anybody, really.

He is currently at Purdue.\\n\u201cOur coaching staff sees the scenario as being mischaracterized and does not have any concerns moving forward,\u201d Purdue told local media in a statement.\\nSilverfield said he learned of the incident shortly after the game in question.\\n\u201cThere were some rumors going around about it, that our playbook had been shared with him from a former player that was no longer part of our program,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it is what it is.\\n\u201cAs disappointing as it is to not win a football game, the circumstances had nothing to do with that. We\u2019ve got to move folks forward. Really, in the last 72 hours, it\u2019s come back to light.

Some around college football believe that if he did return, it would be in the NFL.\\nThe Giants are one team often mentioned with head coach Brian Daboll competing for his job this year. The Cowboys have also been name-dropped, since owner Jerry Jones is always interested in splashy hirings and is feeling the pressure to get the team back to the Super Bowl for the first time since the 1990s.\\nDuring a conversation with FOX News this week, Saban responded to the recent rumors with an answer that won\u2019t quell the speculation.\\n\u201cThere is no opportunity that I know of right now that would convince me to go back to coaching,\u201d Saban said.\\nThe legendary Alabama coach added that he enjoys his media work with ESPN and the extra time he now gets with his family and friends.

He is too old for the work, and the industry has passed him by. But he didn\u2019t. Instead, he just said no opportunity that he knows of at the moment. Well, neither the Giants nor the Cowboys\u2019 head coach jobs are currently open. So he isn\u2019t wrong.\\nHowever, both could be available early next year. If Daboll does not turn New York into a competitive team, he will be ousted. As for new Cowboys head coach Brian Schottenheimer, having Jones as his boss in an era where one-and-done coaching tenures are becoming more frequent means his job is far from safe. Both franchises would give Saban a call at the very least to gauge his interest if they disappoint in 2025.\\nRelated: Urban Meyer adds fuel to speculation of Nick Saban to Cowboys or Giants in 2026\\nRelated Headlines\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 15:33:45 +0000\\n        Source: Sportsnaut\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Where James Franklin ranks in ESPN college football coach ranking\\n        Description: ESPN's Bill Connelly shared his coach rankings for the past 20 years.

The Nittany Lions are predicted to be a Big Ten heavyweight with a legitimate national title aspirations as they look to take the challenging next step as a program Franklin has been harping about for years. No matter what you think about Franklin entering the 2025 season, the numbers do back up the idea that he is among the best in the game. And according to Bill Connelly of ESPN, the numbers have Franklin ranked as one of the four best coaches in college football in 2025.\\nConnelly's mathematical formulas, used to rank just about everything you can imagine in college football, have calculated Franklin to be the fourth-best active college football coach for the upcoming college football season. Two ranked ahead of him, Ohio State's Ryan Day (no. 1) and Georgia's Kirby Smart (no. 3), have national championships to their name. The other, Josh Heupel of Tennessee (no. 2), is questionable if not laughable. Even if you rank Heupel ahead of Franklin, is he really the second-best coach in the sport? Probably not.\\nWhile a small handful of active head coaches currently own national title rings (Clemson's Dabo Swinney joins Day and Smart and may have the Tigers ready to roar back to the national title conversation soon enough after year's ACC championship and playoff appearance), the tenure of Franklin is a bit of a complicated one when determining his success. Penn State has consistently been one of the winningest programs in the country since his arrival, but Franklin's jarring record against top-ranked teams is an unavoidable narrative that is increasingly more difficult to combat even for Franklin's biggest defenders.\\nArguing that Franklin has been a bust for a head coach is ill-advised as he has taken Penn State to a Big Ten title and wins in the Rose Bowl, Fiesta Bowl (twice), and Cotton Bowl, and has helped[d produce some incredible talent for the NFL. But it is also fair to suggest Franklin has failed to getting Penn State to the elite level the program is striving for. After so many years and shortcomings against the same hurdles in the same fashion, the case has been made.\\nBut maybe in 2025, Franklin will finally break free of that narrative once and for all.\\nFollow Kevin McGuire on Threads , Bluesky , Instagram , TikTok , and Facebook .\\nFollow Nittany Lions Wire on X , Facebook , and Threads .\\nThis article originally appeared on Nittany Lions Wire: ESPN formula ranks James Franklin one of best college football coaches\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 15:29:47 +0000\\n        Source: Nittany Lions Wire\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Three \u2018Ifs\u2019 for the Texas A&M Aggies To Win the 2026 College Football Playoff\\n        Description: Texas A&amp;M football is now +3500 on FanDuel, +4000 according to ESPN, to win the 2026 College Football Playoff championship and the Aggies are entering the 2025 regular season with confidence and hope brewing in the locker room.

ESPN's Bill Connelly went through the teams most likely to win the title and gave \\\"ifs\\\" each of them needs to be crowned national champions. Texas A&M, Ohio State, Texas, Notre Dame, and Georgia have three things that need to fall in place.\\n\\n\\n\\\"There's a lot to like about this A&M team,\\\" Connelly wrote . \\\"Quarterback Marcel Reed returns after producing the best QBR of any freshman in the SEC \u2014 that's right, it wasn't LaNorris Sellers or DJ Lagway. Reed was solid in terms of both run and pass, but the Aggies' passing game wasn't very explosive.\\\"\\nThe Aggies need \\\"a bit more pop\\\" to their offense, according to Connelly's first A&M \\\"if.\\\" With the additions of wide receivers KC Concepcion and Mario Craver from the Transfer Portal and incoming freshmen wideouts Terry Bussey and Ashton Bethel-Roman, they'll not only need to replace the top passing targets from 2024-25, but go beyond and add some fire to the offense.\\nThe remaining two \\\"ifs\\\" for Connelly have to do with Texas A&M's defense.\\nFirst, it needs to defend the pass rush better. In 2024-25, the Aggies were 19th in defensive SP+ and 85th in sacks. They need be stronger on the front to match the new depth of the secondary. Connelly believes that transfers Dayon Hayes and T.J. Searcy should pair well with returner Cashius Howell and underclassmen Rylan Kennedy and Solomon Williams.\\nLastly, the defense need to limit big plays. Even with cornerbacks Dezz Ricks and Will Lee III and safeties Dalton Brooks and Marcus Ratcliffe, Texas A&M ended up fourth in college football in completion rate allowed.\\nA 53.3 percent completion rate allowed with a mere 3.7 percent interception rate need to be improved, especially heading into a season where offenses are generally much better across the country than defenses.

On Wednesday, LSU head coach Brian Kelly delivered an emphatic and fiery address to the Baton Rouge Rotary Club, making one thing very clear: everything his program has done this offseason is aimed at winning its opener at Clemson\u2019s Memorial Stadium on August 30.\\nIn what was supposed to be a routine community appearance, Kelly ditched a malfunctioning microphone and projected his voice across the packed room for 25 minutes, matching the volume of his message with its intensity. And that message centered squarely on Clemson.\\n\u201cThis is the first time, in all my years, that I\u2019ve circled game one,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about anything else but 1-0 against Clemson.\u201d\\nBut perhaps the line that will echo the loudest in the Upstate came when Kelly referred to Clemson\u2019s iconic home stadium by a new name: \u201cDeath Valley junior.\u201d\\n\\\"Death Valley Junior... not THE Death Valley!\\\" pic.twitter.com/a0xGxDhTwK\\nThat slight, whether playful or pointed, is certain to reach Dabo Swinney and a Clemson team that\u2019s already looking to reestablish national dominance. Swinney and the Tigers will have plenty of bulletin-board material come fall camp.\\nBut Kelly\u2019s words weren\u2019t just for show. LSU has made Clemson the centerpiece of its offseason mission. The program has installed Clemson paw prints on punching bags in the weight room and plastered \u201c1-0\u201d messages on video boards throughout the facility. It\u2019s a cultural reset in Baton Rouge, where the Tigers have lost five straight season openers and are desperate to start strong in 2025.\\nKelly even dipped into his own wallet, contributing $1 million to a fundraising effort that helped LSU land a top-10 freshman class and one of the best transfer hauls in the country. The result is what Kelly calls \u201cthe best roster we will put out there since I\u2019ve been here,\u201d featuring new playmakers like Barion Brown (Kentucky), Nic Anderson (Oklahoma), and a retooled secondary led by Virginia Tech\u2019s Mansoor Delane.\\nStill, for all the roster upgrades and tactical changes, the emotional fuel is Clemson. And Kelly isn\u2019t shying away from it.\\n\u201cI\u2019d get on a plane or a bus or a train and go watch that game,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s gonna be exciting. Because our players set that as a goal\u2014and it\u2019s attainable.\u201d\\nIf Dabo Swinney and Clemson needed any more motivation heading into fall, Brian Kelly just gave it to them\u2014loud and clear.\\nThis story was originally reported by Athlon Sports on Jul 24, 2025, where it first appeared.\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 15:07:54 +0000\\n        Source: Athlon Sports\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: USC football countdown to kickoff\u2014Mosi Tatupu in focus\\n        Description: Mosi Tatupu was a standout at fullback and on special teams for the Trojans in the 1970s\\n        Link: https://trojanswire.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/trojans/football/2025/07/26/usc-football-countdown-kickoff-trojans-mosi-tatupu/85378879007/\\n        Content: The countdown to USC's 2025 football season is officially on! The Trojans kick off their new campaign 36 days from today. You need something to help you while away the days and hours in the spring and summer. This is one way to do so. In this new series, countdown to kickoff, we will be counting down the days by highlighting a notable Trojan who wore each number. Today, we take it back to the 1970s and look at former USC running back Mosi Tatupu.\\nPosition: Running back\\nYears played at USC: 1974-1977\\nCareer highlights: Coming to USC from Hawaii, Tatupu starred at fullback for the Trojans . He starred on special teams for the Trojans, while also making a name for himself blocking for star running backs Ricky Bell and Charles White. He is a member of the Polynesian Football Hall of Fame.\\nFrom 1997 through 2006, the Mosi Tatupu Award was given out to the top special teams player in college football.\\nAfter USC: The New England Patriots selected Tatupu in the eighth round of the 1978 NFL Draft. He would go on to play 13 of his 14 NFL seasons with the Patriots, becoming a fan favorite and a special teams ace. In 1986, he was named to the Pro Bowl.\\nAfter retiring from football, Tatupu remained in Massachusetts, getting into coaching at the high school and Division III levels. His son, Lofa Tatupu, was an All-American linebacker on USC's early 2000s national championship teams.\\nTatupu passed away in 2010 at the age of 54. According to an autopsy, CTE sustained during his football career played a role in his early death.\\nThis article originally appeared on Trojans Wire: USC football countdown to kickoff recalls Trojans RB Mosi Tatupu\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 15:06:22 +0000\\n        Source: Trojans Wire\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Oklahoma Sooners need a big 2025 season from their defensive backs\\n        Description: If the Oklahoma Sooners defense is going to take another big step, it will be because of the defensive backfield.\\n        Link: https://soonerswire.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/sooners/football/2025/07/26/oklahoma-sooners-football-robert-spears-jennings-eli-bowen/85381418007/\\n        Content: The Oklahoma Sooners have made remarkable strides on the defensive side of the ball since head coach Brent Venables took over. In the 2024 season, OU allowed just 21.5 points per game, good for 29th in the country. Those 21.5 points allowed per game were the least for Oklahoma since 2009, when Venables was the defensive coordinator under Bob Stoops. Now, Venables re-assumes full control over his defense, including play-calling duties.\\nOU's best defense in 15 years was headlined by a very good front seven, specifically a stout and disruptive defensive line that was excellent at stopping the run. A versatile and athletic group of linebackers patrolled the second level of the defense, and they were hard to get past as well.\\nHowever, if the Sooner defense had a weak point last year, it was definitely in the secondary. They struggled at times, especially against some of the more explosive passing offenses they faced in the SEC. In a season where Oklahoma couldn't afford to give up many points to have a chance to win, it was usually the defensive backfield that was the culprit if OU got scored on. If Oklahoma wants to continue to make improvements on defense under Venables, they'll need to stay healthy and become more consistent in the secondary.\\nAs with a lot of other position groups on this team, there are a lot of new faces and changes for OU's defensive backs. The changes started in the winter, when the Sooners lost seniors Billy Bowman Jr., Woodi Washington, and Dez Malone. Bowman would later be drafted in the fifth round of the 2025 NFL draft.\\nBut the defensive backfield also has a different look because of the winter edition of the transfer portal. Among others, Oklahoma's DB room lost Kani Walker (Arkansas), Makari Vickers (Colorado), Jayden Rowe ( Kansas State ), Erik McCarty (Emporia State), and Devon Owen (Emporia State) to the portal during the winter cycle. Of that group, Walker's loss is the biggest. He had started multiple games at cornerback over the previous two seasons for the Sooners.\\nBut the remodel of the secondary wasn't done, because the spring portal window had an impact on the Sooners as well. Oklahoma saw the departures of Mykel Patterson-McDonald, Peter Schuh, and Jocelyn Malaska this spring. Since then, Schuh has found a new home at Marshall, and Malaska has done the same at Abilene Christian.\\nWhen it came to replacing all of those departed players, the Sooners only added one transfer portal defensive back, Reed DeQuasie from Oklahoma State. That's because OU has mostly opted to turn heavily to high school recruiting, signing five defensive backs in the 2025 recruiting class .\\nIn true freshmen Courtland Guillory, Maliek Hawkins, Trystan Haynes, Omarion Robinson, and Marcus Wimberly, the Sooners have the future of their secondary on campus together to begin their college careers in 2025. All five players enrolled together last winter. Venables mentioned Guillory and Robinson as young players that could make an impact during SEC media days.\\nFor the immediate future, Oklahoma will rely on a group of returning veterans to lead the way. It looks like safety Robert Spears-Jennings has been handed the keys to OU's defensive backfield. He was selected to represent the Sooners at SEC media days and posted a very strong 2024 season, finishing second on the team in total tackles.\\nPeyton Bowen will start at the other safety spot and will play more than he ever has in 2025. He saw a lot of time as a rotational safety during his freshman and sophomore years, but will be counted on to carry more of the load as a junior.\\nAt cornerback, the Sooners would love a clean bill of health for their projected starters, Eli Bowen and Gentry Williams. Bowen was in a boot for all of spring ball, while Williams has struggled to stay healthy for almost his entire college career. When he's been on the field, Williams has been excellent.\\nHowever, with injury concerns on the outside, it'll be up to Jacobe Johnson to be ready when his number is called. The local product saw plenty of snaps last season and has the size and athleticism coaches love at corner.\\nDespite the transfer portal losses that depleted some of OU's depth, the Sooners still have some young and versatile pieces waiting for their turn to see the field. Oklahoma has intriguing options at safety in Jaydan Hardy, Michael Boganowski, and Reggie Powers III. At cornerback Devon Jordan and Jeremiah Newcombe will have an opportunity to earn playing time as well.\\nOf course, those players are in addition to the five-man group of true freshmen Oklahoma signed in December. And you can't forget about Kendel Dolby, who will likely start at the second level at the cheetah position, but has the ability to play in the secondary as well.\\nThe Sooners weren't bad in the secondary last year; they just weren't as consistently good as the rest of the defense. If Oklahoma makes another big leap as an overall defense again in 2025, look for the defensive backfield to play a big role in making that happen. Between an exciting youth infusion and veteran stalwarts, there's plenty of potential for improvement in that position group.\\nContact/Follow us @SoonersWire on X, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Oklahoma news, notes, and opinions.

Despite Nussmeier's elder statesmanship, 2024 was his first year as the starter. He sat behind Jayden Daniels in 2022 and 2023, but showed his talent in spurts. Nussmeier was viewed as a strong breakout candidate entering the year, and for the most part, he delivered.\\nNow, Nussmeier is back. Brian Kelly's staff worked the transfer portal hard, signing highly-touted wide receivers and experienced offensive linemen.\\nThose elements give LSU a chance to have the best offense in the SEC.\\nThe numbers back it up. According to Bill Connelly's SP+ projections, LSU's offense ranks No. 2 in the country and sits atop the SEC.\\nFor LSU to reach those heights, a  few things need to go right.\\nNussmeier needs to make the projected jump. Nussmeier looked like the best quarterback in the country at times in 2024. Take the final two drives vs. Ole Miss , where Nussmeier led LSU on a game-tying drive at the end of regulation and not long after found Kyren Lacy for the game-winning touchdown in overtime.\\nThen, Nussmeier and LSU hit a three-game funk. Nussmeier threw a combined five picks vs. Texas A&M and Alabama and averaged just 5.5 yards per attempt vs. Florida.\\nBut the offense returned to form in week 13. LSU finished the year on a three-game winning streak, headlined by efficient play from Nussmeier. That's the Nussmeier LSU needs in 2025.\\nNussmeier will rely on an offensive line that's replacing four starters from the 2024 unit \u2014 LSU's biggest question mark heading into 2025. The Tigers on counting on inexperienced but talented players at both tackle spots. Kelly is bullish on the group, and if Tyree Adams and Weston Davis emerge, LSU's offense has all the pieces to rank atop the SEC.\\nPart of that involves getting the ground game going again, too. LSU struggled to adjust without Jayden Daniels' rushing threat at quarterback. LSU averaged 3.6 yards per carry in conference play, ranking No. 15 in the SEC. That won't cut it if LSU envisions competing for a conference title and a playoff bid.\\nKelly hired former Florida State offensive coordinator Alex Atkins to serve as LSU's run game coordinator. The addition of Atkins, with running back Caden Durham returning, is reason for optimism about LSU's rushing attack.\\nLSU's offense won't match the numbers from 2019 or 2023 -- an unfair standard. But if LSU plays to its talent level, there's not a defense in the SEC that can stop this unit.\\nThis article originally appeared on LSU Wire: Is LSU football's offense the best unit in the SEC?\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 14:46:44 +0000\\n        Source: LSU Tigers Wire\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: 5-star Georgia QB commit Jared Curtis expected to make almost $1M as a freshman\\n        Description: According to Rivals, Georgia Bulldogs quarterback commitment Jared Curtis is expected to be compensated a bargain amount during his freshman year.\\n        Link: https://ugawire.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/bulldogs/football/2025/07/26/georgia-football-quarterback-commit-jared-curtis-nil-deal/85349861007/\\n        Content: The Georgia Bulldogs are putting together one of the best 2026 recruiting class in the nation, headlined by the highly-touted five-star quarterback, Jared Curtis . Curtis committed to the Bulldogs in May and has not shown any signs of decommitting again.\\nAs Curtis prepares for his freshman season in 2026, details regarding his name, image and likeness (NIL) deal with the University of Georgia have emerged. According to Pete Nakos of Rivals , Curtis is projected to earn over $750,000 in his freshman year. That number is anticipated to escalate once he assumes the starting quarterback position for the Bulldogs. It is a bargain compared to other five-star quarterbacks as Tennessee commit Faizon Brandon and BYU commit Ryder Lyons where both are projected to make $1 million or more in their freshman year.\\nCurtis's substantial NIL deal is indicative of the current landscape of college football, where top-tier quarterbacks are commanding significant amount of money. This trend was also highlighted by reports earlier this offseason suggesting that former Georgia quarterback Carson Beck could potentially earn over $6 million for his 2025 season with the Miami Hurricanes.\\nCurtis, currently the sole five-star commit in Georgia's 2026 class, is expected to officially sign with the Bulldogs in Dec. 2025, following his senior year of high school.

Additionally, Miami is the only other program with a quarterback who made that many starts last season, having brought in Carson Beck from Georgia via the transfer portal.\\nESPN college football analyst Greg McElroy spoke about the tiers in the ACC on his podcast, \\\"Always College Football.\\\" In Tier 1, he not only touched on the Clemson Tigers but also focused heavily on the Miami Hurricanes.\\n\\\"Moving next to the Miami Hurricanes. And yes, I include Miami in Tier 1,\\\" McElroy said. \\\"A lot of people might push back on that. Well, Miami can make the playoff, but can they win the national championship? I am a believer. I look at where this team has gone the last couple years, where they've progressed the last couple years, and I happen to think this could be maybe the best year in Mario Cristobal's tenure up to this point.\\\"\\nMiami needed to fill the quarterback void after Cam Ward went No. 1 overall in the 2025 NFL Draft. The Hurricanes went out and landed Beck, who spent four seasons at Georgia, including two as the team's starter.\\nBefore suffering a season-ending torn UCL in his elbow during the SEC Championship Game, he threw for 3,485 yards, 28 touchdowns and 12 interceptions in the 2024 season.\\n\\n\\nMcElroy also discussed Miami's additions and schedule.\\n\\\"I love the additions that they've made in the portal,\\\" McElroy said. \\\"I love the pieces that they bring back.

He was so impressive in the spring of 2024 that he looked like he could be the best wideout in a loaded room in Norman.\\nAfter a solid start to the season, Burks was injured in Week 4 against Tennessee and played in just one more game the rest of the year. He was added to the list of injured OU WRs and part of the reason the Sooners struggled so much on offense last year.\\nBurks decided to come back for his final season at Oklahoma. If he can stay healthy this season, he has a chance to make good on all of the potential he showed in his first spring at OU.\\nAppearing on \\\" That SEC Podcast \\\", SEC Network college football analyst Cole Cubelic identified three breakout candidates in the SEC for this upcoming season. Burks was among them, with Cubelic raving about what Burks could bring to the new offense in Norman.\\n\\\"Deion Burks at Oklahoma, if I said that name, how many people would know who that is?\\\" Cubelic asked. \\\"Dude can freaking go, and if he's healthy, he's a problem.\\\"\\nIt's still a bit of an unknown as to what exact role Burks will have in offensive coordinator Ben Arbuckle's offense. However, Arbuckle probably likes that opponents don't know what to expect out of Burks in the new system. If Burks can stay healthy, develop chemistry with quarterback John Mateer, and Arbuckle can scheme up touches for the dynamic playmaker, Cubelic could be spot-on about Burks having a big year in 2025.\\n\\nSEC breakout candidates from @colecubelic Oklahoma WR Deion Burks Florida RB Jadan Baugh Mizzou RB Ahmad Hardy Who is your breakout candidate in the SEC?

At the time, management (meaning Al Davis) didn\u2019t like him, and he was too young and immature for the job, but now that he's grown older, he seems to have become a better head coach and has matured.\\nKiffin has had opportunities to leave Ole Miss for other college coaching jobs, but you get the feeling that at some point, if something bigger and better comes along, Kiffin is gone. The only question is, will it be for a bigger college gig or back to the NFL.\\nSteve Sarkisian\\nOut of the names mentioned, Sark might be the guy who could be NFL-bound soon because of Arch Manning. Sarkisian is a quarterback guru, and if Manning has the type of season many think he will, you could easily see a scenario where he and Manning wind up on the same team together as a package deal. Maybe to the New Orleans Saints or the Dallas Cowboys. Stay tuned.\\nKirby Smart\\nSince Nick Saban is no longer coaching, Smart is likely considered the best coach in college football. He\u2019s won two national championships, three SEC titles, and has sent several players to the NFL. Smart seems to be happy at his alma mater, but you have to wonder at some point, is he going to get an itch to try the NFL?\\n\\nIt\u2019s not like he\u2019d have to go far; the Atlanta Falcons are right up the road, and with nearly 30 of his players being arrested since he\u2019s been head coach, he might head to the NFL sooner than we think.\\n\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 13:49:50 +0000\\n        Source: The Sporting News\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Football World Erupts Over Latest NFL News Involving Nick Saban\\n        Description: After a legendary 17-year run in Tuscaloosa and multiple coaching stops before that, Nick Saban announced his retirement from football in January 2024.

Saban was a breakout presence throughout the 2024 season and is expected to return to the desk when the new season kicks off in late August.\\nThat said, Saban\u2019s name suddenly resurfaced in NFL headlines on Wednesday \u2014 sparking fan speculation \u2014 after Fox Sports analyst and \\\"The Herd\\\" host Colin Cowherd tried to connect the dots among the Browns, Saban as a potential head coach and Texas quarterback Arch Manning.\\n\u201cThis is the worst-kept secret in the South,\u201d Cowherd said. \u201cHaslam \u2014 Jimmy \u2014 the Browns' owner, a huge SEC and Tennessee booster, leans heavily on the Manning family. \u2026 Arch Manning is part of that family. This is where Saban comes in. He\u2019s incredibly close to both Jimmy Haslam and the Mannings. If he could land a top quarterback \u2014 like Harbaugh going to the Chargers for Herbert \u2014he\u2019d absolutely take a phone call from the NFL.\u201d\\nColin Cowherd has heard that the Browns and Jimmy Haslam are eyeing both Arch Manning and Nick Saban \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40 pic.twitter.com/MZUEgXIlE9\\nThis jibes with what Saban himself said earlier this year on \\\"The Pivot\\\" podcast with Ryan Clark, where he admitted that if he ever returned to coaching, it would likely be at the NFL level. He pointed to the shifting landscape of college football, NIL deals and the ever-expanding transfer portal as reasons for his departure.\\n\u201cI love coaching pro ball,\u201d Saban said. \u201cAnd if I was going to coach today, based on the circumstances in college and the NFL, I would coach in the NFL \u2014 because all those things in college have changed.\u201d\\nAt the end of the day, all of this could amount to nothing more than speculation.

We asked coaches and players from around the conference how they've adapted to a new era:\\n        Link: https://www.thestarpress.com/story/sports/college/ball-state/2025/07/26/how-mac-football-has-shifted-in-the-nil-and-transfer-portal-era-college-football-ball-state/85282000007/\\n        Content: DETROIT \u2014 In recent years, it has become more and more challenging to be a college football head coach.\\nGone are the days of recruiting players and coaching them up for four or five years. Instead, the sport finds itself in an era of unprecedented player movement thanks to the transfer portal quickly facilitating moves between NCAA institutions with few restrictions.\\nWidespread tampering under the guise of name, image and likeness (NIL) deals has only exacerbated such movement. While schools and coaches can't directly recruit players from other teams, there are no rules preventing independent NIL collectives from negotiating with agents and making offers to players to enter the portal. This has created a system where the top players in the NCAA's non-autonomous conferences (Group of 5) are often poached by teams in autonomous conferences (Power 4).\\nThe Mid-American Conference is in the former group, seeing its top talent migrate up to the Power 4 level more frequently over the last few years. Of the 11 players on the 2024 All-MAC first-team who retained eligibility for 2025, only two will return to their 2024 teams. Meanwhile, eight of the nine who transferred wound up at Power 4 schools.\\nThis new era raises plenty of questions. How can the coaches of the MAC best respond and adapt to the constant roster turnover? Does the constantly looming threat of the portal affect locker rooms during the season? How understanding are players when their teammates move on? Well, like almost everything else, it varies from school to school.\\nMore: 'Pirate mentality' guiding MAC commissioner through uncertain times in college football\\nMore: 'Establish our standards': How Ball State football coach Mike Uremovich is shifting the culture\\nPerhaps the most eventful transfer portal season among the MAC belongs to Ball State . Exactly half of its roster \u2014 55 out of 110 players \u2014 is new this season, and new head coach Mike Uremovich replaced almost the entire staff with his own guys. With more new faces than old, it's been easier for everyone to get on the same page as the program begins a new era.\\n\\\"The new guys who came in and the guys who were returning, it was all new to them, so they were all going through it for the first time.\\\" Uremovich said. \\\"It's fun to watch that all coming together, and then you have the new crop of guys that comes in May and June and high school guys, so we've got to get those guys bought in too.\\\"\\nThe Cardinals are one of six teams in the MAC who will have a new coach this season. This group includes the reigning MAC champion Ohio Bobcats , as former offensive coordinator Brian Smith will take over the head coaching post from Tim Albin, who took the Charlotte job mere hours after the MAC title game.\\nDespite Albin's stunning move and the fact that he took a slew of assistant coaches with him, Ohio only lost a handful of players to the portal. The Bobcats have also had success recruiting from the portal, as many of the key contributors to their conference championship victory were former transfers.\\n\\\"When you really emphasize the culture within your program and that gets built among the players that are in it, and you are constantly emphasizing it within your team, the new players are going to be able to adapt to that culture, or they're not going to work out,\\\" Smith said. \\\"We've done a good job of identifying kids that we think fit what we do from a program standpoint, but also culturally.\\\"\\nAnother team with limited roster turnover this offseason was Buffalo . The Bulls had the MAC's least active portal period in terms of both transfers out and in, and they were one of the two teams to retain a 2024 first-team All-MAC player with linebacker Red Murdock. Going into his second season as the head coach, Pete Lembo takes pride in the Bulls' limited movement and cited the program's emphasis on relationships as a key factor in the continuity.\\n\\\"I think the best way to overcome those (challenges) is to do what we've always done, which is build great relationships,\\\" Lembo said. \\\"The reason I got into coaching 30-plus years ago was because I enjoyed the relationships, player-to-player, coach-to-player, the staff, the administration, and those things haven't changed.\\\"\\nOf course, not every team in the conference was as fortunate as Ohio and Buffalo. Eastern Michigan , for example, has 50 new players this season. Twelfth-year coach Chris Creighton \u2014 tied for the longest tenured head coach in the MAC \u2014 remembers a time before the conference was ravaged by the portal and has had to adapt to its new landscape. Creighton believes that his adaptation has been made easier by the fact that his team culture is firmly solidified with his decade-plus of experience with the Eagles.\\n\\\"Our guys know who they are, so we can recruit to that,\\\" Creighton said. \\\"We're not trying to figure out who we are, we're not trying to establish who we are. That's what we want to continue to be really strong in, is knowing who we are and having a certain culture.\\\"\\nWhile one might expect constant roster turnover and NIL negotiations to create animosity or jealousy within a locker room, the players of the MAC are generally understanding. Most players get the \\\"business decision\\\" nature of their teammates who opt for the portal, and those who stick around know they need to rally around the next man up.\\n\\\"We're not going to dwell on who's not here,\\\" said Eastern Michigan defensive lineman Jefferson Adam. \\\"You know, best of luck to them, but we're just building off what we have because that's ultimately what's most important.\\\"\\nPlayers who do decide to stay often play a role in convincing others to do the same. For coaches who now have to worry about re-recruiting their own players, having players who can do it for them is a big advantage.\\n\\\"For a head coach, it's one of your biggest jobs to recruit your own roster,\\\" Western Michigan coach Lance Taylor said. \\\"Your own players can be a huge part of that because honestly, those are the guys that they battle with every single day. They live with them, they hang out with them, they have really close and deep relationships.\\\"\\nThose relationships don't expire when players do decide to leave. Adam, a former Iowa State transfer, is still in touch with some of his Cyclones teammates. Ohio quarterback Parker Navarro spent his first two seasons at UCF, where he met two friends who he remained close enough with to be in each of their weddings recently. Ball State defensive tackle Darin Conley is still close with many of the former Cardinals who left this offseason and continues to support them in their new destinations.\\n\\\"You've got to remember these guys were our teammates,\\\" Conley said. \\\"We've been through thick and thin, they just happened to go somewhere they thing was a benefit for them. You can't really hate or knock them for that. With the guys who transferred, we're still close friends. A lot of guys still hang out with each other because we still kind of live close.\\n\\\"They're still our guys, and we're still going to love them. They're just not currently our teammates.\\\"\\n\\nContact Cade Hampton via email at cbhampton@muncie.gannett.com or on X, formerly known as Twitter, @CadeHamp10 .\\nThis article originally appeared on Muncie Star Press: How MAC football has shifted in the NIL and transfer portal era\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 13:07:51 +0000\\n        Source: The Star Press\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: ESPN names their biggest question marks, 'what-ifs' for Alabama football in 2025\\n        Description: The quarterback position and Alabama's pass rush were named by ESPN as the Crimson Tide's biggest 'what-ifs' for 2025.\\n        Link: https://rolltidewire.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/crimson-tide/football/2025/07/26/alabama-football-schedule-2025-biggest-what-ifs/85383202007/\\n        Content: ESPN college football analyst Bill Connelly thinks the Alabama Crimson Tide have as good a chance as almost anyone to win the national championship in 2025.\\nConnelly, a leading figure behind ESPN's popular analytics-driven SP+ rankings, recently listed potential title contenders for 2025 with his annual 'what-ifs' for each team . Alabama tied with Penn State for the fewest question marks entering the season with only two.\\nAlabama's 'what-ifs': the quarterback position, led for the moment by junior Ty Simpson, and the defense's ability to get after the quarterback.\\nTo the former, coach Kalen DeBoer and offensive coordinator Ryan Grubb named Simpson the frontrunner as spring practice wrapped up in April following Alabama's annual A-Day event.\\nThe concern for Simpson is obvious, mainly his lack of experience. In parts of three seasons, he's 29-of-50 for 381 yards through the air while rushing for 130 yards and three touchdowns in 15 games. Most of that was in mop-up duty with the exception of Alabama's ugly 17-3 win at South Florida in September 2023.\\nSimpson's next college start will be his first, but Connelly contends that Simpson may not necessarily need to be elite in order to succeed. Think of Jake Coker, who led Alabama to the national championship in 2015.\\nConnelly said:\\n\\\"Honestly, after Jalen Milroe's negative-play troubles in 2024 (11 interceptions, 9 fumbles, 23 sacks), there's a path for Simpson to succeed by simply making sure the team in crimson controls the ball. He'll have strong weapons to whom he can distribute the ball -- Ryan Williams, slot man\u00a0Germie Bernard, Miami transfer\u00a0Isaiah Horton, young former star recruits such as\u00a0Jaylen Mbakwe,\u00a0Jalen Hale\u00a0and\u00a0Cole Adams\u00a0-- and lord knows he has waited for this opportunity. If he can't deliver early, sophomore\u00a0Austin Mack\u00a0or freshman\u00a0Keelon Russell\u00a0(the No. 2 player in the 2025 class) could step in. One way or another, solid quarterbacking could take Bama far.\\\"\\nThe concern for Alabama's pass rush stems from the defense registering just 25 sacks all of last year. Nearly one-third of those came in two games: the Crimson Tide's Week 2 win over South Florida and their 27-25 victory over South Carolina on Oct. 12. Alabama racked up four sacks in each of those games.\\nMoreover, the Tide's sack leaders from a year ago, linebackers Jihaad Campbell and Que Robinson, both departed for the NFL.\\nPer Connelly:\\n\\\"(T)he pass rush really was a liability at times, and the only two players with more than 2.5 sacks last season are gone. Outside linebackers\u00a0Jah-Marien Latham\u00a0and\u00a0Qua Russaw\u00a0look the part but had just one sack each. One way or another, the pressure needs to improve.\\\"\\nApart from Russaw, two players that pressure should come from are inside threats like Tim Keenan III (40 tackles, 2.5 sacks in 2025) and LT Overton (42 tackles, 2.0 sacks).\\nDeBoer was asked at SEC media days earlier this month who stood out as pass rushers heading into the season.\\n\\\"I think guys like\u00a0LT Overton\u00a0jump out with me,\\\" he said. \\\"LT was there a lot last year. Those are the next steps you want to take. Not just he, but a lot of guys finishing the plays. LT has it in him, the seal set. He has those instincts. Continues to hone in on taking it to the next level.\\n\\\"Qua Russaw is another guy,\\\" DeBoer continued. \\\"Some underclassmen are coming up that are doing a nice job, too. Looking forward to the progress they've made physically to be able to put themselves in a chance to let their work happen on the football field on Saturdays.\\\"\\nAlabama will open the season against Florida State at Doak Campbell Stadium in Tallahassee on Aug. 30. Kickoff is scheduled for 2:30 p.m. CT.

That stands out from the rest.\\\"\\nIt likely wasn\u2019t an easy battle to come out on top of either, as Wiltfong also reported that the Georgia Bulldogs, the Michigan Wolverines, the Ohio State Buckeyes and the Penn State Nittany Lions were among the quarterback\u2019s other finalists.\\n\\n\\nJarrard also becomes just the third player that Notre Dame and Freeman have landed in the 2027 class , joining three-star linebacker Ellis McGaskin and unrated long snapper Sean Kraft, both of whom committed in June.\\nRelated: Paul Finebaum Didn't Hesitate to Name the Best Player in College Football\\nThis story was originally reported by Athlon Sports on Jul 24, 2025, where it first appeared.\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 21:31:39 +0000\\n        Source: Athlon Sports\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Paul Finebaum praises Moore\u2019s words but doubts Michigan\u2019s CFP bid with Underwood at QB\\n        Description: Paul Finebaum and Harry Douglas debate Michigan\u2019s 2025 rebound with QB Underwood.

Though expected to be ranked in the polls entering 2025, a lot are saying that the schedule is too hard (there's only one team on it that was a College Football Playoff team last year, and Michigan beat them), or that there's too much to fix.\\nBut, as some who are looking at the situation more closely following the Wolverines ' 8-5 season think there's a chance for a decent rebound.\\nAppearing on ESPN's Get Up on Friday , Paul Finebaum and Harry Douglas both shared their thoughts on Sherrone Moore and the maize and blue, with Finebaum initially reacting to Moore's Big Ten media days comments where he said, 'don't let a speed bump become a roadblock.'\\n\\\"I like what he said there. It's hard to find a criticism of a coach who ended the season beating your biggest rival and then beating Alabama in a bowl game with almost no starters as a double-digit (underdog),\\\" Finebaum said. \\\"Sherrone Moore is saying the right things. My question is, does he have the right stuff as a head coach? He did a nice job filling in for Jim Harbaugh during all of the controversy. But he didn't show anyone much last year other than at the very end. He's gotta be more consistent. He does only the best quarterback coming into college football this year in Bryce Underwood. How long will Bryce Underwood take to matriculate? And if he can get him going quickly, they have a chance for a CFP bid, but I don't think they're going to make it. I think they'll fall just short.\\\"\\nDouglas agrees with most of Finebaum's assessment, but thinks that just by having Underwood under center, if he is named the starter as expected, that will fix a lot of ills given the problems Michigan had a year ago.\\n\\\"They're gonna be better because the speed bump in 2024 was the quarterback position,\\\" Douglas said. \\\"There's three games that I have circled: it's the Oklahoma game when they go to Oklahoma, it's the Nebraska game, and it's the Ohio State game. If they can go 2-1 in those games, those three games that I just mentioned, they have an opportunity to make the College Football Playoff because their schedule isn't hard.\\\"\\nFans will get an opportunity to see the new-look Wolverines on August 30 when they host New Mexico for the 2025 season opener at The Big House.\\nThis article originally appeared on Wolverines Wire: Paul Finebaum says Michigan CFP chances rely on Bryce Underwood\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 21:27:48 +0000\\n        Source: Wolverines Wire\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Sherrone Moore and Chip Lindsey aim for balanced, dynamic Michigan offense in 2025 season\\n        Description: Michigan's new offense under Chip Lindsey promises balance and surprises, debuting vs. New Mexico.\\n        Link: https://wolverineswire.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/wolverines/football/2025/07/26/michigan-football-new-offense-chip-lindsey-sherrone-moore-2025/85390302007/\\n        Content: Michigan football fans got a small preview of what the new-look offense might be in the spring game, but not fully. The team was in a split-squad, but not in an A offense vs. B defense sort of way, as the teams were selected via draft. So what Chip Lindsey brings to the table as the Wolverines ' new offensive coordinator remains to be seen.\\nWhat will be interesting is how he meshes with head coach Sherrone Moore's vision. As the former offensive coordinator for the maize and blue himself, Moore's offense was smashmouth, and there's no indication that that will change overall. In fact, as Moore said at Big Ten media days, while 'SMASH!' is the primary directive of that side of the ball, there was a lot more capability we didn't see, situationally -- but this year it might be different.\\n\\\"I think where me and Chip are really similar is just he wanted to do the best for what\u2019s best for our offense, what\u2019s best for our players,\\\" Moore said. \\\"And even when I was calling offenses it wasn\u2019t about like I wanted to just -- people say, 'Oh, we just wanted to run the football.' That\u2019s not really true. There\u2019s times we did, but I wanted to be balanced. Sometimes that balance got out of whack because either I got mad or we wanted to set a tone, and we did that, but it\u2019s really about balance.\\n\\\"And people say we didn\u2019t throw the ball. J.J. McCarthy was quarterback of the year in the Big Ten, as voted by the coaches. So you can\u2019t say that we can\u2019t throw the ball when the quarterback is the quarterback of the year. So I really feel strongly that it\u2019s all about balance and he wants that.\\\"\\nAs Moore notes, it's all about balance, but balance doesn't mean equal reps of run and pass or even equal outcomes. But it is about setting the expectation, having prolific production from multiple positions, and keeping a defense off-kilter.\\nAnd that's something that Lindsey is familiar with.\\n\\\"He\u2019s been a guy that\u2019s had a 1,000-yard rusher, had a 3,000-yard passer,\\\" Moore said. \\\"Fun stat about Chip, he was the offense coordinator at Southern Miss that had 2,000 yard rushers and a 3,000 and a 4,000-yard passer, and I was at Louisville at that time and had like a 1,000 yard rusher and 3,000 yard (passer). So he understands football, he understands the game.\\n\\\"Where we\u2019re different, I don\u2019t know. There\u2019s a lot of different things -- we think about different plays differently. Not necessarily total philosophy, but Chip\u2019s not like a, 'Hey, I just want to be an up-tempo, spread guy.' He\u2019s a balanced guy and does whatever\u2019s best for your program and team. We\u2019ll have those elements in the game. We\u2019ll be able to do things like that, but we\u2019ve always had that. We just chose not to do it as much, where we might, where we might not.

So, just proud of him, and we just need him to you know, stay focused week in and week out, continue to be the leader that he\u2019s been\u2026 That's where it all starts is trying to you know win your league, you know, be the champion of this league. He's done that twice now, and if he does that again this year, then he'll have an opportunity to prove it on a bigger stage.\u201d\\n\\n\\nKlubnik did have his best season at the collegiate level in 2024, completing 308-of-486 passes for 3,639 yards, 36 touchdowns and six interceptions, while also showing off some dual-threat ability with 463 rushing yards and seven touchdowns.\\nEven though those numbers were solid, it was far from a Heisman Trophy stat line, as he received zero votes , so if Klubnik wants to be the first player for Clemson to bring home the award in program history, he will need to seriously improve.\\nLeading the Tigers to a second straight ACC title would certainly help his case and as of now, that's the expectation, with ESPN BET giving them the best odds (+110) to win the conference.\\nIf they did come out on top, it would propel Clemson into the College Football Playoff, where the race for their first national championship win since 2018 and third under Swinney would officially be on.\\nIt's certainly a tough road ahead, though, as Klubnik's Heisman aspirations will be tested early on with a Week 1 matchup against the LSU Tigers, who are looking to compete for their own conference title within the SEC.\\nRelated: Colorado Reacts to Travis Hunter Earning Huge Honor During Jaguars Training Camp\\nThis story was originally reported by Athlon Sports on Jul 24, 2025, where it first appeared.\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 20:03:26 +0000\\n        Source: Athlon Sports\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Deion Sanders lands on list of college football coaches with most to prove in 2025\\n        Description: Fox Sports named Deion Sanders one of 2025's most pressured coaches as he enters his third season at the helm of Colorado.\\n        Link: https://coloradobuffaloeswire.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/buffaloes/football/2025/07/26/deion-sanders-college-football-coach-pressure-ranking-2025/85388810007/\\n        Content: Colorado Buffaloes head coach Deion Sanders was included on Fox Sports' list of the 10 college football head coaches with the most to prove entering the 2025 season.\\nSanders, who took over Colorado after the 2022 season, landed at No. 9 on the ranking.

With that talent comes major expectations, pressure from fans and media, and talk of a national title run. Franklin isn't shying away from addressing it.\\nThe head coach knows the pressures that come with leading an elite program, especially in Happy Valley as part of the Big Ten. As preseason camp gets underway, Franklin met with the media during Big Ten Media Day and didn\u2019t sugarcoat his message about the national title buzz.\\n\u201cA lot of people worked really hard to put ourselves in this position,\u201d Franklin said.\\nThen came the real message from Franklin.\\n\u201cNo one gives a [expletive] about preseason rankings.\u201d\\n\\n\\nThe Nittany Lions won their first seven games of the 2024 season. Their only regular season loss came on Nov. 2 in a 20-13 home defeat to Ohio State. Penn State bounced back with four straight wins to earn a spot in the Big Ten title game.\\nThere, Franklin's squad came up short in a 45-37 shootout against Oregon in Indianapolis. Despite the loss, their full-season r\u00e9sum\u00e9 was strong enough to earn a College Football Playoff berth.\\nPenn State made the most of the opportunity, blowing out SMU 38-10 in their first playoff game, then defeating Boise State 31-14 in Glendale, Arizona.\\nIn the CFP semifinal, the Nittany Lions lost to Notre Dame 27-24 on a late field goal. Franklin noted they were one drive away from reaching the final.\\nLooking ahead to this season, ESPN's College Football Power Index ranked Penn State fifth behind Texas, Georgia, Alabama and Ohio State. The Nittany Lions were given a 7% chance to win out and claim the College Football Playoff title.\\nFranklin returns a solid core from last year\u2019s team. Quarterback Drew Allar leads the group, entering his fourth season with 29 career starts. In 2024, he threw for 3,327 yards and 24 touchdowns. Running back Nicholas Singleton is also back for his senior season, having scored 32 rushing touchdowns and eight receiving TDs across his first three seasons.\\nPenn State\u2019s projected starting receivers are all transfers. Kyron Hudson, Devonte Ross and Trebor Pena are expected to make up the starting trio and bring new energy to the offense.\\nThe Nittany Lions open the 2025 season at home on Aug. 30 against Nevada.\\nRelated: Jeremiah Smith Announces Major NIL Deal After Freshman Season at Ohio State\\nRelated: Kirby Smart Wins Recruiting Battle for 4-Star Cornerback\\nThis story was originally reported by Athlon Sports on Jul 24, 2025, where it first appeared.\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 20:01:23 +0000\\n        Source: Athlon Sports\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Florida Trending for Prospect Tabbed Next Freshman Phenom\\n        Description: It would be a major get for the Gators.\\n        Link: https://athlonsports.com/college/florida-gators/florida-trending-for-prospect-tabbed-next-freshman-phenom\\n        Content: Florida Trending for Prospect Tabbed Next Freshman Phenom originally appeared on Athlon Sports .\\nThe Florida Gators are in the hunt for a very intriguing college football prospect from the 2028 class.\\nSocial media blew up last weekend after a crazy one-handed catch was made at the NFL Flag Championships by receiver Brysen Wright.

Smith burst onto the scene last season, leading the Buckeyes with 1,315 receiving yards as a true freshman.\\nSmith was a former five-star prospect and the top receiver in the 2024 class. Wright is rated as a four-star on Rivals, and On3's Hayes Fawcett believes the recruit will be one of the prospects in the class.\\nWright is familiar with Florida, as the Gators had him in town for an unofficial visit in November of last year.

Ryals has worn many hats on the defensive side of the ball, most recently serving as inside linebackers coach for the 2022-\u201924 seasons.\\nThe new DCs aren\u2019t expecting to change much on defense. For the most part, THS\u2019 defense will look like it has in years past, with some changes coming on a game-to-game basis.\\nRyals mug\\nCody Ryals\\n\u201cIt\u2019s par for the course; I was with [Wilson] forever and you can talk about the X\u2019s and O\u2019s that all the coaches do. It\u2019s about those boys who get out there and play on Friday nights,\u201d Ryals said. \u201cit\u2019s not like we\u2019re reinventing the wheel or changing the system.\u201d\\nThat deep knowledge and experience was a big reason why THS head coach Brad Gilbert put the duo in the co-DC role.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s [10 years] they have been in our system together and they have a good grasp of what works and what doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Gilbert said. \u201cI like the fact they are eager, and they\u2019ve reached out to other coaches who run the offensive front, looking to gain new ideas. I appreciate their loyalty. They\u2019ve been with us for as many years as they have, and they\u2019ve just been loyal to the program. They care about these young men.\u201d\\nIchniowski has been with the program for 14 seasons but wasn\u2019t originally on the defensive side of the ball. When Wilson came in, Ichniowski moved to defense in a group he enjoys in the linebackers.\\nStepping into the DC position has changed how Ichniowski views the game.\\n\u201cI have to have a much bigger picture in my mind of what\u2019s going on,\u201d Ichniowski said. \u201cI have been more involved in what our overall goals should be and what our defense needs to accomplish. That\u2019s everything from player positions to what kind of coverages we run against certain offensive schemes.\u201d\\nIn previous seasons, the duo had input on the plays THS was running, but now they have the game-time decision making.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s a different set of responsibilities, a different mindset,\u201d Ichniowski said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of the same stuff; once we get into the season, it will be a little different as far as calling plays and being more involved in the scouting, practice planning and stuff like that.\u201d\\nThe Tigers\u2019 defense looks like it will be very solid, with key players returning in every position.\\nTraeven Morrison is one of four returning starting linebackers. Synjin Sampson highlights the safeties for the Tigers, and Elvis Myers and Kingston Hall headline the defensive rushing attack. There is returning talent from top to bottom with the Tigers\u2019 defense, and the DC duo sees a chance for a strong unit.\\n\u201cWe returned the entire linebacker corps,\u201d Ryals said. \u201cWe return a bunch of production from those guys. It\u2019s all about them; they are the ones who go out there and play on Friday nights. They\u2019re the ones who put the show on.\u201d\\nMonday, July 28 starts the final week of summer pride workouts for the Tigers.\\nAfter the workouts, the Tigers will go into a dead period before starting practices Monday, Aug. 11.\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 19:51:00 +0000\\n        Source: Tahlequah Daily Press, Okla.\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: ESPN sends sad message on Colorado Buffaloes football coach Deion Sanders\u2019 time in Boulder\\n        Description: Colorado Buffaloes football coach Deion Sanders doesn't have nearly the audience he used to.\\n        Link: https://www.sportingnews.com/us/ncaa-football/news/espn-sends-sad-message-colorado-buffaloes-football-coach-deion-sanders-time-boulder/49075be3ebd4cd68c4f5fc11\\n        Content: ESPN senior director of programming and acquisitions Kurt Dargis made a somewhat sad revelation about Colorado Buffaloes football coach Deion Sanders:\\nHis first year in Boulder was the true ratings-grabber, but the Buffs\u2019 9-4 2024 campaign didn\u2019t get nearly the same fanfare.\\nDargis mentioned Sanders in a question about whether or not Bill Belichick\u2019s North Carolina Tar Heels program could mirror the same monstrous ratings Colorado got during Coach Prime\u2019s first Power 4 season in 2023.\\nDargis sees potential for \u201cChapel Bill\\\" this fall.\\n\u201cWe have to wait and see.

Heading into the 2025 season, the Nittany Lions return four out of five starters, a level of continuity that\u2019s rare in college football. This group is experienced, physical, and finally built to push around elite defenses.\\nWhen you have that kind of chemistry in the trenches, everything else opens up. The quarterbacks stay clean and the running backs find lanes. The whole offense breathes easier. For a team that wants to make a legit playoff run once again, having a veteran line is exactly the foundation you want.\\nDrew Shelton has been tested on the edge and continues to improve every year. Nick Dawkins and Vega Ioane also provide critical depth and flexibility. If injuries hit, the drop-off won\u2019t be major. That\u2019s what makes this line so scary. These aren\u2019t just big bodies; they\u2019re leaders who know how to win in the Big Ten.\\nWhat separates this O-line from past Penn State units is balance. These guys aren\u2019t just built to run block or pass protect, they can do both at a high level. You saw glimpses of it last season when they controlled the line of scrimmage in big games, but now the expectation is domination week to week.\\nIn short-yardage situations, this group can lean on people. In passing situations, they can give Drew Allar the time he needs to go through his reads and take deep shots. There\u2019s no glaring weakness. Every guy on this line plays with an edge, and they\u2019ve been through enough together to trust each other when the pressure hits.\\nIf Penn State\u2019s offensive line stays healthy and plays to its potential, this team can absolutely win the Big Ten and make a push for the College Football Playoff. Success for this unit means keeping Drew Allar clean, helping Nicholas Singleton and Kaytron Allen hit 1,000 yards again , and setting the tone every Saturday.\\nA disappointing year would mean inconsistent protection, missed blocks in key moments, or lack of push in short-yardage. But right now, everything is pointing in the opposite direction.\\nThis offensive line isn\u2019t flashy and that\u2019s exactly why it works.

A one-time national champion, Williams' top season at Alabama came in 2018 when the defensive tackle had 71 tackles, 20 TFL, and eight sacks to win the Outland Trophy.\\n\\nReuben Foster is among the most talented inside linebackers in Alabama program history, finishing his four seasons in Tuscaloosa from 2013-16 with a combined 222 tackles, 24 TFL, eight sacks, and 11 PD. Foster, a one-time national champion, had likely his best season at Alabama in 2016 when he had 115 tackles, 13 TFL, and five sacks to win the Butkus Award.\\n\\nCam Robinson started for each of his three seasons in Tuscaloosa at left tackle, eventually departing Alabama as one of the top offensive linemen in the program's storied history. A one-time national champion, likely Robinson's greatest season at Alabama was his 2016 campaign in which he won the Outland Trophy.\\n\\nA three-year running back at Alabama, Trent Richardson compiled a total of 3,130 yards and 35 touchdown on 540 attempts from 2009-11, while also hauling in 68 receptions for 730 yards and seven more scores, as well as 700+ yards as a kick returner. Richardson, a two-time national champion, had likely his best season at Alabama in 2011 where he led the SEC with 1,679 yards and 21 touchdowns to win the Doak Walker Award.\\n\\nA four-year impact player in Alabama's backfield, running back Najee Harris racked up a combined 3,843 yards and 46 touchdowns on 638 attempts from 2017-20, while also hauling in 80 receptions for 781 yards and 11 additional scores.

Jones' best season at Alabama was likely his 2010 campaign in which he hauled in 78 receptions for 1,133 yards and seven touchdowns, each of which were career-high's.\\n\\nAlabama's first-ever Heisman Trophy winner, running back Mark Ingram spent three years at Alabama from 2008-10 where he racked up a combined 3,261 yards and 42 touchdowns on 572 attempts, while also hauling in 60 catches for 670 yards and four more scores.

Cooper, a one-time national champion, also had a memorable year in 2014 where he led the SEC with 1,727 receiving yards and 16 touchdowns (also led college football with 124 total receptions) to win the Biletnikoff Award.\\n\\nA two-year starter who delivered one of the biggest moments in Alabama program history , Tua Tagovailoa, over three seasons at Alabama from 2017-19, completed 69.3% of passes for 7,442 yards and an 87:11 TD:INT ratio, while also rushing for nine more scores. Tagovailoa, a one-time national champion, had likely his best season in 2018 where he led the SEC with a 69 CMP%, 3,966 passing yards, and 43 touchdowns, among other categories, while winning the Maxwell and Walter Camp Awards, as well as finishing runner-up for the Heisman Trophy.\\n\\nWhen it comes to defensive players alone, an argument can certainly be made that Will Anderson Jr., an outside linebacker who had a combined 205 tackles, 63 TFL, 34.5 sacks, one interception, four PD, and a forced fumble across three seasons from 2020-22, is the best at Alabama since 2000. A one-time national champion, Anderson led the SEC in both TFL and sacks during the 2021 and 2022 seasons (led college football in 2021) , and was a two-time Nagurski Award winner who also won the Bednarik, Lott, and Lombardi Awards in 2022 as well.\\n\\nAt Alabama for three seasons from 2013-15, running back Derrick Henry ended his time in Tuscaloosa with 3,591 rushing yards and 42 touchdowns on 602 career attempts, while also hauling in 17 receptions for 285 yards and three more scores. A one-time national champion, Henry also had one of the best seasons Alabama has ever seen from a running back in 2015 where he led college football with 2,219 rushing yards and 28 touchdowns, receiving multiple honors that included the Heisman Trophy, Doak Walker, Maxwell, and Walter Camp Awards.\\n\\nOne of the highest-rated recruits in Alabama football history , Bryce Young spent three seasons in Tuscaloosa, two of which he started at quarterback, where he overall completed 65.8% of his passes for 8,356 yards and an 80:12 TD:INT ratio from 2020-22, while also rushing for seven more scores. A one-time national champion, Young also won numerous honors following his 2021 season that included the Heisman Trophy, Davey O'Brien, Manning, and Maxwell Awards, one in which he led the SEC with 4,872 passing yards and 47 touchdowns.\\n\\nAlabama's all-time leading receiver , DeVonta Smith spent four seasons at Alabama where he hauled in a combined 235 receptions for his career with 3,965 yards and 46 touchdowns from 2017-20, while also adding two more scores through the rushing and return game. A two-time national champion, Smith also won the 2020 Heisman Trophy, as well as the Biletnikoff, Maxwell, and Walter Camp Awards following one of the best season's Alabama has ever seen from a wide receiver in which he led the nation with 117 receptions for 1,856 yards and 23 touchdowns.\\nContact/Follow us @RollTideWire on X, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Alabama news, notes and opinion .\\nThis article originally appeared on Roll Tide Wire: Alabama football top players since 2000: DeVonta Smith tops ranking\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 19:00:28 +0000\\n        Source: Roll Tide Wire\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Rising 2027 Talent Reveals 'Cousin' Trying to Court Him to USC\\n        Description: The USC Trojans sit in a comfortable spot with their 2026 class at No. 1 overall.

This past week, Big Ten media days unfolded in Las Vegas, kicking off the year for the sport's biggest conference.\\nIn a recent story , ESPN's Bill Connelly gave a detailed 2025 outlook for every Big Ten team. Here is what he had to say about USC.\\n\\\"When you've gone just 15-13 in your last 28 games at USC, as Riley has since an 11-1 start, your name is going to automatically show up on \\\"hot seat\\\" lists. That's just the way it works. But damned if Riley isn't building his team like a guy with the best job security in the world. His Trojans' win total has fallen for two straight years, but he signed only 16 transfers, an average number in 2025, and less than half of them are seniors. He elected to stick with junior\u00a0Jayden Maiava\u00a0at quarterback after four solid but unspectacular starts. And despite losing quite a bit of depth from his first semi-competent defense in four years -- only 10 of 13 players with 300-plus snaps return -- he definitely didn't overdo it with portal guys.\\n\\\"Riley reportedly has a pretty prohibitive buyout at the moment, and he's acting like it. Though this team does have a handful of pretty good seniors -- linebacker\u00a0Eric Gentry\u00a0and incoming transfers in running back\u00a0Eli Sanders\u00a0(New Mexico), cornerback\u00a0DJ Harvey\u00a0(San Jos\u00e9 State) and safety\u00a0Bishop Fitzgerald\u00a0(NC State) -- most of this team's best players are guys who will still have eligibility left in 2026, when members of what is currently\u00a0a spectacular recruiting class\u00a0come to town. Steel yourself for some serious USC hype this time next year, I guess.\\n\\\"D'Anton Lynn did a nice job in his first season as defensive coordinator; the Trojans improved from 105th to 48th in defensive SP+, thanks mostly to big-play prevention and outstanding third-down defense. Safety\u00a0Kamari Ramsey\u00a0is the only returning starter in the secondary, but he's great, and Harvey and Fitzgerald should help. Gentry is a good playmaker at linebacker, and the addition of 330-pounder\u00a0Keeshawn Silver\u00a0(Kentucky) and 350-pounder\u00a0Jamaal Jarrett\u00a0(Georgia) up front should certainly provide some, uh, immovability. I don't expect an elite defense, but further improvement is likely.\\n\\\"On offense, Maiava is a decent scrambler, Sanders and juco transfer Waymond Jordan are exciting and explosive additions, and slot receiver\u00a0Makai Lemon\u00a0averaged a whopping 3.0 yards per route, second in the conference.\\n\\\"The line is more experienced, especially with the additions of senior transfers\u00a0J'Onre Reed\u00a0(Syracuse) and\u00a0DJ Wingfield\u00a0(Purdue), but I'm not sure about the upside there. Regardless, Riley should have enough to field another top-20 offense, develop further, win another seven or eight games and buy time for the cavalry to arrive in 2026.\\\"\\nWhile USC fans are certainly not expecting a national championship this season, another year of winning seven or eight games is certainly not what anyone is looking for. Riley and the Trojans will look to prove Connelly's projections wrong on the field this fall.\\nThis article originally appeared on Trojans Wire: What are ESPN's expectations for USC football in 2025\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 18:42:18 +0000\\n        Source: Trojans Wire\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Paul Finebaum isn't buying the hype over marquee Clemson football opponent in 2025\\n        Description: Paul Finebaum is far from sold on one of the biggest opponents on the Clemson Tigers' 2025 football schedule.\\n        Link: https://clemsonwire.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/clemson/football/2025/07/26/bill-belichick-unc-football-paul-finebaum-blasts-legendary-coach/85387660007/\\n        Content: Longtime college football voice Paul Finebaum isn't buying the hype over one ACC program and Clemson opponent on the Tigers' 2025 schedule.\\nAppearing on Friday's episode of \\\"Get Up\\\" on ESPN, Finebaum joined host Mike Greenberg and panelists Harry Douglass, Damien Woody and Mike Tannenbaum to discuss some of the top storylines entering the 2025 college football season.\\nOne of the biggest storylines has been Bill Belichick's return to coaching. Belichick is entering his first season at North Carolina just a year removed from a 24-year run with the New England Patriots that included a record six Super Bowl championships.\\nBut many are skeptical that Belichick, 73, still has it and can win big in college football and at UNC. Finebaum is one such cynic. When asked what the realistic expectations were for Belichick in 2025, Finebaum made his stance clear:\\n\\\"They are very low, Greeny, for this reason: he doesn't have a very good team, although he's in a workable league. I think he can win seven games, maybe steal one to go eight. But ladies and gentlemen, this is not Deion Sanders coming back to college for a couple of obvious reasons. Shedeur Sanders and Travis Hunter, he doesn't have anyone like that. Therefore, the eyes of the nation will be there on opening night, maybe a second and third time, but it's not going to be must-see TV.\\\"\\nFinebaum called the end of Belichick's career with the Patriots a \\\"disaster\\\" and recalled that the coach never won a playoff game over his final four seasons in Foxborough.\\n\\\"He had losing seasons three out of the last five (years),\\\" Finebaum added. \\\"It was a mess at the end. He should have been fired earlier than he was, and this is just him trying to make good. He's trying to impress his girlfriend. He's trying to make some money, and ultimately I don't think it's going to work.\\\"\\nClemson will visit North Carolina and Kenan Memorial Stadium for a matchup against Belichick's Tar Heels on Oct. 4. The Tigers haven't played in Chapel Hill since late September 2019 when they avoided an upset by stopping a 2-point conversion with under two minutes to play, preserving a 21-20 victory.\\nThe Tigers haven't lost to UNC since 2010 and have won the last six meetings in the head-to-head series.\\nAt ACC Kickoff in Charlotte this week, Belichick praised Dabo Swinney and the program he's built at Clemson.\\n\\\"We're all learning from Dabo,\\\" Belichick said from the podium on Thursday and added, \\\"Dabo has been a friend for a long time. We've scouted his players from the NFL down. Some of the players that are here today, I actually thought maybe we'll be drafting one of these guys, and now here we are going to be playing against them.\\n\\\"Dabo has been great. I have so much respect for him and the Clemson program, what he's done, the way he runs it. It's high quality. Kids are high quality. He came up to New England and got probably the top player out of New England in probably the last decade in Christian Wilkins... I think that says a lot for the program that he runs and what he's done for not only college football but all the student-athletes that he's coached there. They've gone on to represent him and the school very well.\\\"\\nFor Swinney, the admiration for Belichick is mutual.\\n\\\"I've got a lot of respect for him,\\\" Swinney said this week in Charlotte. \\\"It's well-documented what he's done as a football coach, but I just think he's a very interesting guy. I love talking to him.\\\"\\n\\nClemson opens the 2025 season against the LSU Tigers at Clemson Memorial Stadium in prime time on Aug. 30. Kickoff is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. ET.

Almost offload the offense to them.\\\"\\nWright also thinks that if Saban returns, he wouldn\u2019t want a rebuilding job as he would have had to do in Cleveland, which is why the Bengals would make sense.\\n\\\"You handle the details, finding some of the edges in young players from the college game that you're very aware of their skillset, and coach up the defense. Because the only point that you made that I disagree with is, if I'm Nick Saban and I want to do this, I'm not that interested in a studs-to-the-top-down rebuild. I'm much more interested in, I've got three or four years. Let me see if I can have a contender immediately. I think the Bengals who, if they miss the playoffs again, probably will be looking for a new coach. I think they could be an attractive one.\\\"\\nWright makes an interesting and compelling argument for the Bengals than Cowherd did for the Browns.\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 18:31:17 +0000\\n        Source: The Sporting News\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Ranking the SEC\u2019s Top 10 Cornerbacks for the 2025 College Football Season\\n        Description: It should be a strong year for cornerbacks in the SEC.

A shutdown corner can change the completion of a defense. When a defensive coordinator trusts a corner on an island, it makes everything easier for the rest of the unit.\\nSafeties can help in run support, and playcallers can dial up creative blitzes. If another player in the secondary is struggling, resources can be allocated there because the coaches know the shutdown corner doesn't need any help.\\nLSU football fans have become familiar with elite cornerback play over the years. LSU is known as \\\"DBU\\\", even if the Tigers' secondary hasn't been up to standard in recent years. LSU is hoping that changes this year with the addition of some top transfers, along with five-star freshman DJ Pickett.\\nCornerback play around the SEC is expected to be strong with several of the top names from 2024 set to return. With kick-off one month away, here's a look at the SEC's top cornerbacks for the 2025 football season.\\nLee joined Auburn in 2023 as a four-star recruit from Georgia. He saw time as a true freshman, playing 336 snaps, but 2024 was a breakout year for the cornerback. Lee's 58.0 passer rating targeted ranks second among returning SEC corners, only trailing the guy who is No. 1 on this list.\\nLee broke up four passes with two picks and forced seven incompletions. Quarterbacks weren't afraid to throw his direction, but he made them pay. Opposing offenses completed just 46.9% of passes when throwing at Lee.\\nDomani Jackson has a strong case to be higher on this list was named Second Team Preseason All-SEC at SEC Media Days. He has the attention of NFL scouts, and with a strong 2025, he'll be a first-round pick in next year's NFL Draft.\\nJackson is a former five-star recruit who began his career at USC. 2024 was Jackson's first year with the Tide, and he broke up five passes while recording two interceptions. Jackson made 15 stops and had a 63.0 passer rating when targeted.\\nExpect a big year from the talented veteran in 2025.\\nDelane was one of the top available corners in the transfer portal. With LSU needing help in the secondary, the Tigers made Delane a priority and secured his commitment.\\nDelane was Third-Team All-ACC with Virginia Tech in 2024. He posted a 69.5 PFF defensive grade and allowed a completion percentage of 47.2%, which ranked seventh among ACC cornerbacks. Delane is a big and physical corner who will replace Zy Alexander in the boundary.\\nDelane has a knack for forcing turnovers with six career picks and four forced fumbles.\\n\\\"Mansoor Delane has been very, very impactful at the cornerback position,\\\" LSU head coach Brian Kelly said.\\nJackson wasn't the only Alabama corner to make this list -- he's joined by teammate Zabien Brown.\\nBrown made an instant impact as a five-star freshman in 2024. He played 660 snaps and posted a PFF coverage grade of 70.8. Brown's allowed completion percentage of 45% ranks fourth among returning SEC cornerbacks and he allowed a reception once per 18.7 coverage snaps. That's close to an elite mark.\\nNow, as Brown enters his sophomore year, he looks to take another step. If he progresses at this rate, he has a chance to be the best corner in the SEC by season's end.\\nBowen's 78.7 PFF coverage grade ranks second among returning SEC cornerbacks. He was a three-star recruit, but he exceeded all expectations and made a massive impact as a true freshman. Bowen served as a rotational piece early in the year, but took over as a starter in week seven and didn't look back.\\nBowen stands at 5-foot-9, but he punches above his weight and can play on the outside.\\nLSU got the best of Bowen, targeting him for 115 yards. But it's hard to find any blemishes outside of that. Look for Bown to emerge as a star in 2025.\\nDaylen Everette earned First Team Preseason All-SEC honors at media days. The veteran Georgia cornerback has over 1,600 snaps under his belt after three years with the Bulldawgs and now looks to have a career campaign as a senior.\\nEverette has eight career pass breakups with four picks. Three of those picks came in 2024, when Everette posted a 73.3 PFF coverage grade. Everette forced two fumbles and registered a sack, too.\\nGeorgia needs Everette to perform at a superstar level as the Dawgs look to get back to playing national championship-level defense after the unit was down a tick in 2024.\\nLee was one of the top-ranked transfers in last year's transfer class. Texas A&M was searching for an impact corner and got just what it was looking for.\\nLee posted a 71.8 coverage grade and allowed just 47.2% of targets to be completed, which was one of the best marks in the SEC. Standing at 6-foot-3, Lee is one of the most physical corners in the conference. Despite just being in college for two years, Lee has already played 1,000+ snaps of quality football.\\nLee has the upside to be an All-American and a first-round pick in next year's NFL Draft.\\nMuhammad has big shoes to fill. Star Texas corner Jhadae Barron is off to the NFL, leaving Muhammad as the feature piece in the secondary.\\nMuhammad was a highly touted recruit in the class of 2023, just missing the cut to be a five-star. He broke up nine passes in 2024, which is tied for the best mark among returning SEC cornerbacks. He can blanket receivers and opponents only completed 50% of passes when throwing his way.\\nMuhammad has the talent to be an All-American corner. Texas needs Muhammad to play at that level with the departure of Barron.\\nI'm doing some projection here after Crawford's stellar true freshman campaign. But the numbers back it up.\\nCrawford's forced incompletion rate of 28% ranks No. 1 among returning SEC corners. His allowed completion percentage of 40.6% is also the best mark in that group. He only allowed 13 catches all year with 19.1 snaps/reception, ranking second among returning SEC corners.\\nCrawford played just 267 snaps, fewer than most of the guys on this list, but he'll be a full-time starter in 2025. His lone bad game came vs. Texas A&M, where he allowed over 100 yards, but Crawford was near perfect outside of that.\\nI expect Crawford to be All-American in 2025.\\nJermod McCoy transferred to Tennessee ahead of 2024 after a standout freshman campaign with Oregon State in 2023. The adjustment to the SEC was seamless as McCoy emerged as one of the top defenders in the conference.\\nMcCoy broke up six passes and picked off four. McCoy was targeted a lot, 62 times, but he was a playmaker when the ball was thrown his way. He forced 12 incompletions, which was one of the best marks in the SEC.\\nThere's one hang-up here, though. McCoy tore his ACL in January, and there's a chance he's not ready for week one. But that's not enough to keep McCoy out of the top spot.

It's a result of the 10 years of success they enjoyed prior to joining the SEC. It's a slate that has some tough road trips and difficult stretches of games. But that's what comes with playing in the SEC . OU will face several challenges, but head coach Brent Venables remains confident in his team ahead of the 2025 season.\\nHowever, not every game is the same, and the teams Oklahoma faces this year have undergone significant turnover from the rosters the Sooners struggled against in 2024. There's an opportunity for OU to have a resurgent season, but they'll need to be on top of their game every single week.\\nFor the Sooners to be in playoff contention, these are the five most important games on their 2025 schedule.\\n\\nTypically, it would be tough to argue that a week two nonconference game holds the most importance in a season. But Oklahoma doesn't simply need to win the game for the record's sake; they need to win it to flip the narrative about the program.\\nIt's an early-season matchup between two iconic brands in primetime. The college football world will be watching.\\nThe Sooners have high expectations for the 2025 season and getting a win over Michigan in week two would provide a ton of confidence for a team looking to re-establish itself as one of the sport's best.\\nThe Texas Longhorns enter the season as the favorites in the SEC. They're among a handful of teams with the best shot to win the national championship. Their Red River Rivals have blown them out in two of Venables' three seasons at the helm. Although there were extenuating circumstances that contributed to Oklahoma's poor offensive performance, it's still a terrible look for the program that invented winning.\\nGoing up against the former five-star quarterback Arch Manning, a talented play-caller in Steve Sarkisian, and one of the best defenses in college football the Sooners will face a significant test when they take on the Longhorns in the Cotton Bowl.\\nThe Red River Showdown doesn't just have on-field implications; it can sway recruiting battles. Perception is often reality, and the perception nationally is that Texas is light years ahead of the Oklahoma Sooners. Whether that's the reality or not, the only way to change that perception is to win the game.\\n\\nThe Oklahoma Sooners held a 14-10 lead midway through the second quarter on the road in Death Valley in 2024. Then the Sooners gave up a 100-yard kickoff return for a touchdown to Anthony Anderson that turned the tide. Including the kick return, the Sooners were outscored 27-3 over the final two and a half quarters.\\nThe Sooners' coverage was exposed by Garrett Nussmeier and Chris Hilton, and the offense couldn't respond.\\nOU will welcome the Tigers to Gaylord-Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium to close out the regular season. This game could have both short-term and long-term ramifications for the future of the program.\\nThe LSU Tigers are expected to be a contender in 2025, and if the Sooners are as good as many think they could be, this game could determine a playoff berth for either team.\\n\\nRight after the Oklahoma Sooners play Arch Manning and the Texas Longhorns in Dallas, the Sooners have to go on the road to face the South Carolina Gamecocks and LaNorris Sellers in Williams-Brice Stadium in South Carolina. Two tough tests against two of the SEC's best quarterbacks and teams in back-to-back weeks.\\nThere isn't a more difficult two-game stretch on the schedule for the Oklahoma Sooners.\\nObviously, Oklahoma wants to win both games, but for them to maintain any playoff aspirations for 2025, they have to come out of this two-game stretch at least 1-1. Lose both and OU would have to run the table over the final five games of the season.\\n\\nThe Oklahoma Sooners pulled off one of the biggest upsets of the season when they beat Alabama 24-3 in Norman last season. The win knocked Alabama out of playoff contention and provided a glimpse of what the Sooners could be along the offensive line when everyone is healthy. The defense was stout, shutting down Jalen Milroe in the run game and picking off a couple of passes that led to scores.\\nAlabama is expected to be a contender this year and you know the Crimson Tide faithful will want to make the Sooners pay for last year's upset.\\nComing out of a bye week, the road trip to Tuscaloosa will kick off a pivotal three-game stretch to close the season against Alabama, Missouri, and LSU.\\nContact/Follow us @SoonersWire on X, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Oklahoma news, notes, and opinions.

The North Cobb (Ga.) High School star picked Notre Dame over Ohio State, Georgia, Penn State and Michigan.\\nThe Irish staff went about recruiting the quarterback position in a unique fashion in the 2027 class, choosing to wait until this summer to offer anyone at the position. When offers did go out the staff offered just two players, with Jarrard being one of the two. It was imperative that Notre Dame land one of those two players, who the staff evaluated as the best fits for the program after months of taking a deep dive into a number of talented quarterbacks. Landing Jarrard gives the Irish one of those two big time prospects and gives the program an elite foundation to build the 2027 class around.\\nThe 6-3, 195-pound quarterback spent his first two seasons of high school at North Cobb (Ga.) Christian, where he passed for 4,712 yards and 49 touchdowns as a two-year starter. Jarrard passed for 2,065 yards as a freshman and then went for 2,647 yards and 31 touchdowns as a sophomore. Jarrard also cut his interceptions down from 11 to 5 in his second season as a starter.\\nJoin the Notre Dame Champions Lounge for the latest intel and analysis of the Fighting Irish!\\nAs the Notre Dame staff began focusing more and more on the 2027 quarterback class a number of players started to emerge. Quarterbacks coach Gino Guidugli spent much of the winter and spring traveling and evaluating players in the class, which included Jarrard. Notre Dame also has him on campus for a workout in early June and throughout the process came away very impressed with his tools and potential as a quarterback. Notre Dame extended a formal offer to Jarrard on June 21st, and the Irish quickly rose to the top of his list.\\nJarrard attended the elite Rivals camp this summer and won top quarterback honors, and there were several Notre Dame commits in attendance as well. By the time that camp was over it appeared the Irish had climbed to the top of the list for Jarrard and in the weeks since Guidugli and the staff were able to convince Jarrard of how well he fits into the program. That pursuit has now ended with Jarrard joining the class, which once again gives Notre Dame a talented quarterback to build the class around.\\nThe North Cobb standout is a four-star recruit that earned a Top 100 grade on the Irish Breakdown board. His sophomore film shows a player with a lot of talent, but his footwork and overall mechanics are still a bit of a work on progress. The potential, however, is outstanding and Jarrard already has a 4.5-star upside grade, which is that of a player that ranks in the Top 50-75. With two years of high school still left there is plenty of time and room for Jarrard to improve, and I expect him to continue climbing up the rankings.\\nOn3/Rivals ranks Jarrard as the No. 52 overall player in the 2027 class and as the No. 2 quarterback in the country.\\nJarrard is the third player to commit to Notre Dame in the 2027 class, joining talented Alabama linebacker Ellis McGaskin and the nation's top snapper in Sean Kraft .\\nOn top of offers from Notre Dame, Ohio State, Georgia, Michigan and Penn State, Jarrard also had scholarship offers from Clemson, Florida State, Miami (Fla.), Auburn, Missouri, Virginia Tech, Wisconsin, Illinois, North Carolina, Arkansas, Indiana, NC State, Syracuse, Mississippi State, Purdue, Boston College, Kentucky, Duke, Minnesota, Virginia, Vanderbilt, Cincinnati and Wake Forest.\\nBe sure to check out the Irish Breakdown message board, the Champions Lounge\\nIrish Breakdown Content\\n2025 Scholarship Chart 2025 Football Schedule\\nNotre Dame 2026 Commits Notre Dame 2026 Scholarship Offers\\n2025 Commit Rankings - Offense 2025 Commit Rankings - Defense\\n2024 Recruiting Class 2023 Recruiting Class 2022 Recruiting Class\\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\\nBecome a premium Irish Breakdown member, which grants you access to all of our premium content and our premium message board!

Well, he\u2019s had to manage your wealth, too,\\\" Swinney said of Klubnik, who has \\\"grown into a great leader of our team.\\\"\\nThe head coach pointed directly to Clemson's industry-leading player retention as proof of his program's unique appeal. While other top programs grapple with mass defections, Clemson consistently keeps its stars, including leading the nation in returning production with 81% overall (86% offense, 75% defense).\\n\\\"We have most of our team back,\\\" Swinney asserted. \\\"These guys can leave anytime they want, but they so they have to choose, first of all, to come, and then they have to choose to stay. And I just think that says a lot about how we put it together on the front end.\\\"\\nSwinney attributes this loyalty to a \\\"purpose-driven\\\" and \\\"relationship-driven\\\" philosophy, rooted in recruiting young men who \\\"really align with our purpose, guys that really value education and want structure and family and accountability.\\\" He insists players choose Clemson not just for football, but for a holistic environment.\\nThis deep-rooted cohesion, combined with last year's taste of glory \u2013 winning the ACC Championship and making a College Football Playoff appearance \u2013 has ignited a powerful fuel for the 2025 campaign. That \\\"glimpse at the top of the mountain,\\\" as Swinney put it, has sent his team back to work with renewed vigor since January.\\nWith \\\"great, great leaders that really, truly care about each other\\\" and a \\\"very clear vision of how they want to finish,\\\" Swinney is confident his experienced, loyal squad is ready to \\\"do the work\\\" necessary to chase a national championship. In a chaotic college football landscape, Dabo Swinney believes Clemson's steadfast culture and veteran leadership are the ultimate competitive advantage.\\nThis story was originally reported by Athlon Sports on Jul 24, 2025, where it first appeared.\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 16:22:55 +0000\\n        Source: Athlon Sports\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: 3 Statistical Goals BYU Should Achieve For Success in 2025\\n        Description: What are some stats BYU should shoot for in order to have a successful 2025 season?\\n        Link: https://www.vanquishthefoe.com/2025/7/26/24473089/3-statistical-goals-byu-football-should-achieve-for-success-in-2025\\n        Content: BYU is set to report to fall camp this  next week. We look at 3 statistical goals the team should aim for.\\n1,000 yards rushing for LJ Martin\\nThis is a big goal. Especially for BYU. Heck, it\u2019s only happened twice since Jamaal Williams did it in 2016, and both times it was one of the greatest running backs in BYU history in Tyler Allgeier. It\u2019s tough to just burden LJ Martin with such an expectation. However, this year, it\u2019s necessary for a few reasons.\\nThe obvious one is the Wasatch Mountain Range-sized question mark at the most important position in the sport of football, quarterback. The running game needs to shoulder more of the load this year to lift the burden off of whoever is behind center. Historically, teams who have a 1,000-yard rusher are able to dictate the tempo of games and keep their team in every ballgame.\\nAnother is that the offensive line should be good again. With the big addition of Andrew Gentry, and a few experienced players switching around, offensive line coach TJ Woods should be able to get a lot out of this unit.\\nHaving a strong rushing attack complemented by a solid defense should give BYU a chance to win every single game on their schedule. A 1,000-yard rusher is a positive symptom of a functioning offense and good offensive line.\\n30+ sacks plus interceptions\\nBYU defensive coordinator Jay Hill is all about creating havoc for opposing offenses. That was on full display in 2024, when the Cougars boasted one of the best defenses in the entire country. It\u2019s not just about limiting yards, it\u2019s about creating more opportunities for BYU\u2019s own offense to score more points. Stealing possessions. Killing opponents\u2019 drives and, consequently, their will.\\nAfter a few seasons of a lackluster pass rush, the Cougars hit their stride in 2024. They notched 20 sacks as a team. Jack Kelley led the way with 5.0 and returns in 2025.\\nWhere the Cougars really separated themselves was getting 22 interceptions. No college football team had more interceptions than BYU in 2024, with only Texas tying them at the top.\\nThat added up to a combined 42 sacks plus interceptions. Getting at least 30 combined sacks and picks seems to be a formula for success. BYU has achieved that three times since 2020, with all three of those seasons ending in double digit wins. The other two years (2022 and 2023) gave BYU a combined record of 13-12.\\nIt seems like BYU being opportunistic and aggressive on defense leads to team success. But interceptions come with a bit of a luck factor. Expecting BYU to lead the nation in interceptions again is unfair. But creating an effective pass rush that makes opposing quarterbacks make poor decisions is a recipe for success.\\n5+ Turnover Margin\\nAlong the same vein as BYU\u2019s defense creating havoc, the offense should also take care of the football. BYU had an elite turnover margin last season, at plus-eight. That ranked 24th-best among the 134 FBS teams in 2024.\\nJake Retzlaff was not a perfect quarterback. At times, he had trouble taking care of the ball. With a change at quarterback coming this season, the Cougars need to focus on avoiding costly turnovers on offense.\\nSince 2020, the Cougars have had a plus-five or better turnover margin three times. And, go figure, it came during the three double-digit win seasons this decade.\\nThe best teams in college football are usually good at avoiding a high number of turnovers while also creating them on defense. BYU did that well last year. Especially with the roster turnover at some key positions, the Cougars will need to duplicate that success in 2025.\\nIf BYU begins to have problems with turnovers on offense, things could get away from the Cougars.\\n\\nMore from vanquishthefoe.com:\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 16:16:54 +0000\\n        Source: SB Nation\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: UTSA QB opens up on former Memphis player sharing playbook in huge college football scandal\\n        Description: &quot;Out of the blue, for whatever reason, [Ra-El] sent me a couple images that were completely irrelevant,&quot; McCown said.\\n        Link: https://nypost.com/2025/07/26/sports/utsa-qb-opens-up-on-former-memphis-player-sharing-playbook-in-huge-college-football-scandal/?utm_source=yahoo&utm_campaign=nypost&utm_medium=referral\\n        Content: UTSA quarterback Owen McCown downplayed any importance of the messages shared with him by ex-Memphis player Tahj Ra-El last season that included parts of the Tigers\u2019 playbook.\\nMcCown told Sports Illustrated he didn\u2019t share the information with teammates or coaches, and that the story, first reported by TigerSportsReport, has been mischaracterized.\\n\u201cOut of the blue, for whatever reason, [Ra-El] sent me a couple images that were completely irrelevant,\u201d McCown said. \u201cIf anybody gets anything, you\u2019re going to look at it, but it was of no help whatsoever to me and anybody, really.

He is too old for the work, and the industry has passed him by. But he didn\u2019t. Instead, he just said no opportunity that he knows of at the moment. Well, neither the Giants nor the Cowboys\u2019 head coach jobs are currently open. So he isn\u2019t wrong.\\nHowever, both could be available early next year. If Daboll does not turn New York into a competitive team, he will be ousted. As for new Cowboys head coach Brian Schottenheimer, having Jones as his boss in an era where one-and-done coaching tenures are becoming more frequent means his job is far from safe. Both franchises would give Saban a call at the very least to gauge his interest if they disappoint in 2025.\\nRelated: Urban Meyer adds fuel to speculation of Nick Saban to Cowboys or Giants in 2026\\nRelated Headlines\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 15:33:45 +0000\\n        Source: Sportsnaut\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Where James Franklin ranks in ESPN college football coach ranking\\n        Description: ESPN's Bill Connelly shared his coach rankings for the past 20 years.

The Nittany Lions are predicted to be a Big Ten heavyweight with a legitimate national title aspirations as they look to take the challenging next step as a program Franklin has been harping about for years. No matter what you think about Franklin entering the 2025 season, the numbers do back up the idea that he is among the best in the game. And according to Bill Connelly of ESPN, the numbers have Franklin ranked as one of the four best coaches in college football in 2025.\\nConnelly's mathematical formulas, used to rank just about everything you can imagine in college football, have calculated Franklin to be the fourth-best active college football coach for the upcoming college football season. Two ranked ahead of him, Ohio State's Ryan Day (no. 1) and Georgia's Kirby Smart (no. 3), have national championships to their name. The other, Josh Heupel of Tennessee (no. 2), is questionable if not laughable. Even if you rank Heupel ahead of Franklin, is he really the second-best coach in the sport? Probably not.\\nWhile a small handful of active head coaches currently own national title rings (Clemson's Dabo Swinney joins Day and Smart and may have the Tigers ready to roar back to the national title conversation soon enough after year's ACC championship and playoff appearance), the tenure of Franklin is a bit of a complicated one when determining his success. Penn State has consistently been one of the winningest programs in the country since his arrival, but Franklin's jarring record against top-ranked teams is an unavoidable narrative that is increasingly more difficult to combat even for Franklin's biggest defenders.\\nArguing that Franklin has been a bust for a head coach is ill-advised as he has taken Penn State to a Big Ten title and wins in the Rose Bowl, Fiesta Bowl (twice), and Cotton Bowl, and has helped[d produce some incredible talent for the NFL. But it is also fair to suggest Franklin has failed to getting Penn State to the elite level the program is striving for. After so many years and shortcomings against the same hurdles in the same fashion, the case has been made.\\nBut maybe in 2025, Franklin will finally break free of that narrative once and for all.\\nFollow Kevin McGuire on Threads , Bluesky , Instagram , TikTok , and Facebook .\\nFollow Nittany Lions Wire on X , Facebook , and Threads .\\nThis article originally appeared on Nittany Lions Wire: ESPN formula ranks James Franklin one of best college football coaches\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 15:29:47 +0000\\n        Source: Nittany Lions Wire\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Three \u2018Ifs\u2019 for the Texas A&M Aggies To Win the 2026 College Football Playoff\\n        Description: Texas A&amp;M football is now +3500 on FanDuel, +4000 according to ESPN, to win the 2026 College Football Playoff championship and the Aggies are entering the 2025 regular season with confidence and hope brewing in the locker room.

Texas A&M, Ohio State, Texas, Notre Dame, and Georgia have three things that need to fall in place.\\n\\n\\n\\\"There's a lot to like about this A&M team,\\\" Connelly wrote . \\\"Quarterback Marcel Reed returns after producing the best QBR of any freshman in the SEC \u2014 that's right, it wasn't LaNorris Sellers or DJ Lagway. Reed was solid in terms of both run and pass, but the Aggies' passing game wasn't very explosive.\\\"\\nThe Aggies need \\\"a bit more pop\\\" to their offense, according to Connelly's first A&M \\\"if.\\\" With the additions of wide receivers KC Concepcion and Mario Craver from the Transfer Portal and incoming freshmen wideouts Terry Bussey and Ashton Bethel-Roman, they'll not only need to replace the top passing targets from 2024-25, but go beyond and add some fire to the offense.\\nThe remaining two \\\"ifs\\\" for Connelly have to do with Texas A&M's defense.\\nFirst, it needs to defend the pass rush better. In 2024-25, the Aggies were 19th in defensive SP+ and 85th in sacks. They need be stronger on the front to match the new depth of the secondary. Connelly believes that transfers Dayon Hayes and T.J. Searcy should pair well with returner Cashius Howell and underclassmen Rylan Kennedy and Solomon Williams.\\nLastly, the defense need to limit big plays. Even with cornerbacks Dezz Ricks and Will Lee III and safeties Dalton Brooks and Marcus Ratcliffe, Texas A&M ended up fourth in college football in completion rate allowed.\\nA 53.3 percent completion rate allowed with a mere 3.7 percent interception rate need to be improved, especially heading into a season where offenses are generally much better across the country than defenses. The Aggies need to minimize the effects of big completions, whether deep passes or limiting the run after catch.\\nTexas A&M's season opens at home against UTSA on Aug. 30.

On Wednesday, LSU head coach Brian Kelly delivered an emphatic and fiery address to the Baton Rouge Rotary Club, making one thing very clear: everything his program has done this offseason is aimed at winning its opener at Clemson\u2019s Memorial Stadium on August 30.\\nIn what was supposed to be a routine community appearance, Kelly ditched a malfunctioning microphone and projected his voice across the packed room for 25 minutes, matching the volume of his message with its intensity. And that message centered squarely on Clemson.\\n\u201cThis is the first time, in all my years, that I\u2019ve circled game one,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about anything else but 1-0 against Clemson.\u201d\\nBut perhaps the line that will echo the loudest in the Upstate came when Kelly referred to Clemson\u2019s iconic home stadium by a new name: \u201cDeath Valley junior.\u201d\\n\\\"Death Valley Junior... not THE Death Valley!\\\" pic.twitter.com/a0xGxDhTwK\\nThat slight, whether playful or pointed, is certain to reach Dabo Swinney and a Clemson team that\u2019s already looking to reestablish national dominance. Swinney and the Tigers will have plenty of bulletin-board material come fall camp.\\nBut Kelly\u2019s words weren\u2019t just for show. LSU has made Clemson the centerpiece of its offseason mission. The program has installed Clemson paw prints on punching bags in the weight room and plastered \u201c1-0\u201d messages on video boards throughout the facility. It\u2019s a cultural reset in Baton Rouge, where the Tigers have lost five straight season openers and are desperate to start strong in 2025.\\nKelly even dipped into his own wallet, contributing $1 million to a fundraising effort that helped LSU land a top-10 freshman class and one of the best transfer hauls in the country. The result is what Kelly calls \u201cthe best roster we will put out there since I\u2019ve been here,\u201d featuring new playmakers like Barion Brown (Kentucky), Nic Anderson (Oklahoma), and a retooled secondary led by Virginia Tech\u2019s Mansoor Delane.\\nStill, for all the roster upgrades and tactical changes, the emotional fuel is Clemson. And Kelly isn\u2019t shying away from it.\\n\u201cI\u2019d get on a plane or a bus or a train and go watch that game,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s gonna be exciting.

The Trojans kick off their new campaign 36 days from today. You need something to help you while away the days and hours in the spring and summer. This is one way to do so. In this new series, countdown to kickoff, we will be counting down the days by highlighting a notable Trojan who wore each number. Today, we take it back to the 1970s and look at former USC running back Mosi Tatupu.\\nPosition: Running back\\nYears played at USC: 1974-1977\\nCareer highlights: Coming to USC from Hawaii, Tatupu starred at fullback for the Trojans . He starred on special teams for the Trojans, while also making a name for himself blocking for star running backs Ricky Bell and Charles White. He is a member of the Polynesian Football Hall of Fame.\\nFrom 1997 through 2006, the Mosi Tatupu Award was given out to the top special teams player in college football.\\nAfter USC: The New England Patriots selected Tatupu in the eighth round of the 1978 NFL Draft. He would go on to play 13 of his 14 NFL seasons with the Patriots, becoming a fan favorite and a special teams ace. In 1986, he was named to the Pro Bowl.\\nAfter retiring from football, Tatupu remained in Massachusetts, getting into coaching at the high school and Division III levels. His son, Lofa Tatupu, was an All-American linebacker on USC's early 2000s national championship teams.\\nTatupu passed away in 2010 at the age of 54. According to an autopsy, CTE sustained during his football career played a role in his early death.\\nThis article originally appeared on Trojans Wire: USC football countdown to kickoff recalls Trojans RB Mosi Tatupu\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 15:06:22 +0000\\n        Source: Trojans Wire\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Oklahoma Sooners need a big 2025 season from their defensive backs\\n        Description: If the Oklahoma Sooners defense is going to take another big step, it will be because of the defensive backfield.\\n        Link: https://soonerswire.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/sooners/football/2025/07/26/oklahoma-sooners-football-robert-spears-jennings-eli-bowen/85381418007/\\n        Content: The Oklahoma Sooners have made remarkable strides on the defensive side of the ball since head coach Brent Venables took over. In the 2024 season, OU allowed just 21.5 points per game, good for 29th in the country. Those 21.5 points allowed per game were the least for Oklahoma since 2009, when Venables was the defensive coordinator under Bob Stoops. Now, Venables re-assumes full control over his defense, including play-calling duties.\\nOU's best defense in 15 years was headlined by a very good front seven, specifically a stout and disruptive defensive line that was excellent at stopping the run. A versatile and athletic group of linebackers patrolled the second level of the defense, and they were hard to get past as well.\\nHowever, if the Sooner defense had a weak point last year, it was definitely in the secondary. They struggled at times, especially against some of the more explosive passing offenses they faced in the SEC. In a season where Oklahoma couldn't afford to give up many points to have a chance to win, it was usually the defensive backfield that was the culprit if OU got scored on. If Oklahoma wants to continue to make improvements on defense under Venables, they'll need to stay healthy and become more consistent in the secondary.\\nAs with a lot of other position groups on this team, there are a lot of new faces and changes for OU's defensive backs. The changes started in the winter, when the Sooners lost seniors Billy Bowman Jr., Woodi Washington, and Dez Malone. Bowman would later be drafted in the fifth round of the 2025 NFL draft.\\nBut the defensive backfield also has a different look because of the winter edition of the transfer portal. Among others, Oklahoma's DB room lost Kani Walker (Arkansas), Makari Vickers (Colorado), Jayden Rowe ( Kansas State ), Erik McCarty (Emporia State), and Devon Owen (Emporia State) to the portal during the winter cycle. Of that group, Walker's loss is the biggest. He had started multiple games at cornerback over the previous two seasons for the Sooners.\\nBut the remodel of the secondary wasn't done, because the spring portal window had an impact on the Sooners as well. Oklahoma saw the departures of Mykel Patterson-McDonald, Peter Schuh, and Jocelyn Malaska this spring. Since then, Schuh has found a new home at Marshall, and Malaska has done the same at Abilene Christian.\\nWhen it came to replacing all of those departed players, the Sooners only added one transfer portal defensive back, Reed DeQuasie from Oklahoma State. That's because OU has mostly opted to turn heavily to high school recruiting, signing five defensive backs in the 2025 recruiting class .\\nIn true freshmen Courtland Guillory, Maliek Hawkins, Trystan Haynes, Omarion Robinson, and Marcus Wimberly, the Sooners have the future of their secondary on campus together to begin their college careers in 2025. All five players enrolled together last winter. Venables mentioned Guillory and Robinson as young players that could make an impact during SEC media days.\\nFor the immediate future, Oklahoma will rely on a group of returning veterans to lead the way. It looks like safety Robert Spears-Jennings has been handed the keys to OU's defensive backfield. He was selected to represent the Sooners at SEC media days and posted a very strong 2024 season, finishing second on the team in total tackles.\\nPeyton Bowen will start at the other safety spot and will play more than he ever has in 2025. He saw a lot of time as a rotational safety during his freshman and sophomore years, but will be counted on to carry more of the load as a junior.\\nAt cornerback, the Sooners would love a clean bill of health for their projected starters, Eli Bowen and Gentry Williams. Bowen was in a boot for all of spring ball, while Williams has struggled to stay healthy for almost his entire college career. When he's been on the field, Williams has been excellent.\\nHowever, with injury concerns on the outside, it'll be up to Jacobe Johnson to be ready when his number is called. The local product saw plenty of snaps last season and has the size and athleticism coaches love at corner.\\nDespite the transfer portal losses that depleted some of OU's depth, the Sooners still have some young and versatile pieces waiting for their turn to see the field. Oklahoma has intriguing options at safety in Jaydan Hardy, Michael Boganowski, and Reggie Powers III. At cornerback Devon Jordan and Jeremiah Newcombe will have an opportunity to earn playing time as well.\\nOf course, those players are in addition to the five-man group of true freshmen Oklahoma signed in December. And you can't forget about Kendel Dolby, who will likely start at the second level at the cheetah position, but has the ability to play in the secondary as well.\\nThe Sooners weren't bad in the secondary last year; they just weren't as consistently good as the rest of the defense. If Oklahoma makes another big leap as an overall defense again in 2025, look for the defensive backfield to play a big role in making that happen. Between an exciting youth infusion and veteran stalwarts, there's plenty of potential for improvement in that position group.\\nContact/Follow us @SoonersWire on X, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Oklahoma news, notes, and opinions.

Despite Nussmeier's elder statesmanship, 2024 was his first year as the starter. He sat behind Jayden Daniels in 2022 and 2023, but showed his talent in spurts. Nussmeier was viewed as a strong breakout candidate entering the year, and for the most part, he delivered.\\nNow, Nussmeier is back. Brian Kelly's staff worked the transfer portal hard, signing highly-touted wide receivers and experienced offensive linemen.\\nThose elements give LSU a chance to have the best offense in the SEC.\\nThe numbers back it up. According to Bill Connelly's SP+ projections, LSU's offense ranks No. 2 in the country and sits atop the SEC.\\nFor LSU to reach those heights, a  few things need to go right.\\nNussmeier needs to make the projected jump. Nussmeier looked like the best quarterback in the country at times in 2024. Take the final two drives vs. Ole Miss , where Nussmeier led LSU on a game-tying drive at the end of regulation and not long after found Kyren Lacy for the game-winning touchdown in overtime.\\nThen, Nussmeier and LSU hit a three-game funk. Nussmeier threw a combined five picks vs. Texas A&M and Alabama and averaged just 5.5 yards per attempt vs. Florida.\\nBut the offense returned to form in week 13. LSU finished the year on a three-game winning streak, headlined by efficient play from Nussmeier. That's the Nussmeier LSU needs in 2025.\\nNussmeier will rely on an offensive line that's replacing four starters from the 2024 unit \u2014 LSU's biggest question mark heading into 2025. The Tigers on counting on inexperienced but talented players at both tackle spots. Kelly is bullish on the group, and if Tyree Adams and Weston Davis emerge, LSU's offense has all the pieces to rank atop the SEC.\\nPart of that involves getting the ground game going again, too. LSU struggled to adjust without Jayden Daniels' rushing threat at quarterback. LSU averaged 3.6 yards per carry in conference play, ranking No. 15 in the SEC. That won't cut it if LSU envisions competing for a conference title and a playoff bid.\\nKelly hired former Florida State offensive coordinator Alex Atkins to serve as LSU's run game coordinator. The addition of Atkins, with running back Caden Durham returning, is reason for optimism about LSU's rushing attack.\\nLSU's offense won't match the numbers from 2019 or 2023 -- an unfair standard. But if LSU plays to its talent level, there's not a defense in the SEC that can stop this unit.\\nThis article originally appeared on LSU Wire: Is LSU football's offense the best unit in the SEC?\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 14:46:44 +0000\\n        Source: LSU Tigers Wire\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: 5-star Georgia QB commit Jared Curtis expected to make almost $1M as a freshman\\n        Description: According to Rivals, Georgia Bulldogs quarterback commitment Jared Curtis is expected to be compensated a bargain amount during his freshman year.\\n        Link: https://ugawire.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/bulldogs/football/2025/07/26/georgia-football-quarterback-commit-jared-curtis-nil-deal/85349861007/\\n        Content: The Georgia Bulldogs are putting together one of the best 2026 recruiting class in the nation, headlined by the highly-touted five-star quarterback, Jared Curtis . Curtis committed to the Bulldogs in May and has not shown any signs of decommitting again.\\nAs Curtis prepares for his freshman season in 2026, details regarding his name, image and likeness (NIL) deal with the University of Georgia have emerged. According to Pete Nakos of Rivals , Curtis is projected to earn over $750,000 in his freshman year. That number is anticipated to escalate once he assumes the starting quarterback position for the Bulldogs. It is a bargain compared to other five-star quarterbacks as Tennessee commit Faizon Brandon and BYU commit Ryder Lyons where both are projected to make $1 million or more in their freshman year.\\nCurtis's substantial NIL deal is indicative of the current landscape of college football, where top-tier quarterbacks are commanding significant amount of money. This trend was also highlighted by reports earlier this offseason suggesting that former Georgia quarterback Carson Beck could potentially earn over $6 million for his 2025 season with the Miami Hurricanes.\\nCurtis, currently the sole five-star commit in Georgia's 2026 class, is expected to officially sign with the Bulldogs in Dec. 2025, following his senior year of high school.

Additionally, Miami is the only other program with a quarterback who made that many starts last season, having brought in Carson Beck from Georgia via the transfer portal.\\nESPN college football analyst Greg McElroy spoke about the tiers in the ACC on his podcast, \\\"Always College Football.\\\" In Tier 1, he not only touched on the Clemson Tigers but also focused heavily on the Miami Hurricanes.\\n\\\"Moving next to the Miami Hurricanes.

Burks was among them, with Cubelic raving about what Burks could bring to the new offense in Norman.\\n\\\"Deion Burks at Oklahoma, if I said that name, how many people would know who that is?\\\" Cubelic asked. \\\"Dude can freaking go, and if he's healthy, he's a problem.\\\"\\nIt's still a bit of an unknown as to what exact role Burks will have in offensive coordinator Ben Arbuckle's offense. However, Arbuckle probably likes that opponents don't know what to expect out of Burks in the new system. If Burks can stay healthy, develop chemistry with quarterback John Mateer, and Arbuckle can scheme up touches for the dynamic playmaker, Cubelic could be spot-on about Burks having a big year in 2025.\\n\\nSEC breakout candidates from @colecubelic Oklahoma WR Deion Burks Florida RB Jadan Baugh Mizzou RB Ahmad Hardy Who is your breakout candidate in the SEC?

At the time, management (meaning Al Davis) didn\u2019t like him, and he was too young and immature for the job, but now that he's grown older, he seems to have become a better head coach and has matured.\\nKiffin has had opportunities to leave Ole Miss for other college coaching jobs, but you get the feeling that at some point, if something bigger and better comes along, Kiffin is gone. The only question is, will it be for a bigger college gig or back to the NFL.\\nSteve Sarkisian\\nOut of the names mentioned, Sark might be the guy who could be NFL-bound soon because of Arch Manning. Sarkisian is a quarterback guru, and if Manning has the type of season many think he will, you could easily see a scenario where he and Manning wind up on the same team together as a package deal. Maybe to the New Orleans Saints or the Dallas Cowboys. Stay tuned.\\nKirby Smart\\nSince Nick Saban is no longer coaching, Smart is likely considered the best coach in college football. He\u2019s won two national championships, three SEC titles, and has sent several players to the NFL. Smart seems to be happy at his alma mater, but you have to wonder at some point, is he going to get an itch to try the NFL?\\n\\nIt\u2019s not like he\u2019d have to go far; the Atlanta Falcons are right up the road, and with nearly 30 of his players being arrested since he\u2019s been head coach, he might head to the NFL sooner than we think.\\n\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 13:49:50 +0000\\n        Source: The Sporting News\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: Football World Erupts Over Latest NFL News Involving Nick Saban\\n        Description: After a legendary 17-year run in Tuscaloosa and multiple coaching stops before that, Nick Saban announced his retirement from football in January 2024.

Saban was a breakout presence throughout the 2024 season and is expected to return to the desk when the new season kicks off in late August.\\nThat said, Saban\u2019s name suddenly resurfaced in NFL headlines on Wednesday \u2014 sparking fan speculation \u2014 after Fox Sports analyst and \\\"The Herd\\\" host Colin Cowherd tried to connect the dots among the Browns, Saban as a potential head coach and Texas quarterback Arch Manning.\\n\u201cThis is the worst-kept secret in the South,\u201d Cowherd said. \u201cHaslam \u2014 Jimmy \u2014 the Browns' owner, a huge SEC and Tennessee booster, leans heavily on the Manning family. \u2026 Arch Manning is part of that family. This is where Saban comes in. He\u2019s incredibly close to both Jimmy Haslam and the Mannings. If he could land a top quarterback \u2014 like Harbaugh going to the Chargers for Herbert \u2014he\u2019d absolutely take a phone call from the NFL.\u201d\\nColin Cowherd has heard that the Browns and Jimmy Haslam are eyeing both Arch Manning and Nick Saban \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40 pic.twitter.com/MZUEgXIlE9\\nThis jibes with what Saban himself said earlier this year on \\\"The Pivot\\\" podcast with Ryan Clark, where he admitted that if he ever returned to coaching, it would likely be at the NFL level. He pointed to the shifting landscape of college football, NIL deals and the ever-expanding transfer portal as reasons for his departure.\\n\u201cI love coaching pro ball,\u201d Saban said. \u201cAnd if I was going to coach today, based on the circumstances in college and the NFL, I would coach in the NFL \u2014 because all those things in college have changed.\u201d\\nAt the end of the day, all of this could amount to nothing more than speculation. Saban would be on the cusp of turning 75 by the time he\u2019d realistically consider returning to the sideline, and it would have to be a near-perfect situation to lure him back into coaching.\\nSaban was on the Browns staff under Bill Belichick early in his career and was the head coach of the Miami Dolphins from 2005 to 2006, posting a 15\u201317 record over two seasons before returning to the college ranks and furthering his legacy at Alabama.\\nStill, Cowherd's comments sent shockwaves through the football world, with fans trying to wrap their heads around the idea of Saban even entertaining a job in Cleveland \u2014 or possibly New Orleans \u2014 at this stage in his life and career.\\n\\\"Saban coming to fix the Browns would be his biggest accomplishment yet,\\\" a fan said.\\nSomeone else added , \\\"I can definitely see Saban and Manning in New Orleans.

We asked coaches and players from around the conference how they've adapted to a new era:\\n        Link: https://www.thestarpress.com/story/sports/college/ball-state/2025/07/26/how-mac-football-has-shifted-in-the-nil-and-transfer-portal-era-college-football-ball-state/85282000007/\\n        Content: DETROIT \u2014 In recent years, it has become more and more challenging to be a college football head coach.\\nGone are the days of recruiting players and coaching them up for four or five years. Instead, the sport finds itself in an era of unprecedented player movement thanks to the transfer portal quickly facilitating moves between NCAA institutions with few restrictions.\\nWidespread tampering under the guise of name, image and likeness (NIL) deals has only exacerbated such movement. While schools and coaches can't directly recruit players from other teams, there are no rules preventing independent NIL collectives from negotiating with agents and making offers to players to enter the portal. This has created a system where the top players in the NCAA's non-autonomous conferences (Group of 5) are often poached by teams in autonomous conferences (Power 4).\\nThe Mid-American Conference is in the former group, seeing its top talent migrate up to the Power 4 level more frequently over the last few years. Of the 11 players on the 2024 All-MAC first-team who retained eligibility for 2025, only two will return to their 2024 teams. Meanwhile, eight of the nine who transferred wound up at Power 4 schools.\\nThis new era raises plenty of questions. How can the coaches of the MAC best respond and adapt to the constant roster turnover? Does the constantly looming threat of the portal affect locker rooms during the season? How understanding are players when their teammates move on? Well, like almost everything else, it varies from school to school.\\nMore: 'Pirate mentality' guiding MAC commissioner through uncertain times in college football\\nMore: 'Establish our standards': How Ball State football coach Mike Uremovich is shifting the culture\\nPerhaps the most eventful transfer portal season among the MAC belongs to Ball State . Exactly half of its roster \u2014 55 out of 110 players \u2014 is new this season, and new head coach Mike Uremovich replaced almost the entire staff with his own guys. With more new faces than old, it's been easier for everyone to get on the same page as the program begins a new era.\\n\\\"The new guys who came in and the guys who were returning, it was all new to them, so they were all going through it for the first time.\\\" Uremovich said. \\\"It's fun to watch that all coming together, and then you have the new crop of guys that comes in May and June and high school guys, so we've got to get those guys bought in too.\\\"\\nThe Cardinals are one of six teams in the MAC who will have a new coach this season. This group includes the reigning MAC champion Ohio Bobcats , as former offensive coordinator Brian Smith will take over the head coaching post from Tim Albin, who took the Charlotte job mere hours after the MAC title game.\\nDespite Albin's stunning move and the fact that he took a slew of assistant coaches with him, Ohio only lost a handful of players to the portal. The Bobcats have also had success recruiting from the portal, as many of the key contributors to their conference championship victory were former transfers.\\n\\\"When you really emphasize the culture within your program and that gets built among the players that are in it, and you are constantly emphasizing it within your team, the new players are going to be able to adapt to that culture, or they're not going to work out,\\\" Smith said. \\\"We've done a good job of identifying kids that we think fit what we do from a program standpoint, but also culturally.\\\"\\nAnother team with limited roster turnover this offseason was Buffalo . The Bulls had the MAC's least active portal period in terms of both transfers out and in, and they were one of the two teams to retain a 2024 first-team All-MAC player with linebacker Red Murdock. Going into his second season as the head coach, Pete Lembo takes pride in the Bulls' limited movement and cited the program's emphasis on relationships as a key factor in the continuity.\\n\\\"I think the best way to overcome those (challenges) is to do what we've always done, which is build great relationships,\\\" Lembo said. \\\"The reason I got into coaching 30-plus years ago was because I enjoyed the relationships, player-to-player, coach-to-player, the staff, the administration, and those things haven't changed.\\\"\\nOf course, not every team in the conference was as fortunate as Ohio and Buffalo. Eastern Michigan , for example, has 50 new players this season. Twelfth-year coach Chris Creighton \u2014 tied for the longest tenured head coach in the MAC \u2014 remembers a time before the conference was ravaged by the portal and has had to adapt to its new landscape. Creighton believes that his adaptation has been made easier by the fact that his team culture is firmly solidified with his decade-plus of experience with the Eagles.\\n\\\"Our guys know who they are, so we can recruit to that,\\\" Creighton said. \\\"We're not trying to figure out who we are, we're not trying to establish who we are. That's what we want to continue to be really strong in, is knowing who we are and having a certain culture.\\\"\\nWhile one might expect constant roster turnover and NIL negotiations to create animosity or jealousy within a locker room, the players of the MAC are generally understanding. Most players get the \\\"business decision\\\" nature of their teammates who opt for the portal, and those who stick around know they need to rally around the next man up.\\n\\\"We're not going to dwell on who's not here,\\\" said Eastern Michigan defensive lineman Jefferson Adam. \\\"You know, best of luck to them, but we're just building off what we have because that's ultimately what's most important.\\\"\\nPlayers who do decide to stay often play a role in convincing others to do the same. For coaches who now have to worry about re-recruiting their own players, having players who can do it for them is a big advantage.\\n\\\"For a head coach, it's one of your biggest jobs to recruit your own roster,\\\" Western Michigan coach Lance Taylor said. \\\"Your own players can be a huge part of that because honestly, those are the guys that they battle with every single day. They live with them, they hang out with them, they have really close and deep relationships.\\\"\\nThose relationships don't expire when players do decide to leave. Adam, a former Iowa State transfer, is still in touch with some of his Cyclones teammates. Ohio quarterback Parker Navarro spent his first two seasons at UCF, where he met two friends who he remained close enough with to be in each of their weddings recently. Ball State defensive tackle Darin Conley is still close with many of the former Cardinals who left this offseason and continues to support them in their new destinations.\\n\\\"You've got to remember these guys were our teammates,\\\" Conley said. \\\"We've been through thick and thin, they just happened to go somewhere they thing was a benefit for them. You can't really hate or knock them for that. With the guys who transferred, we're still close friends. A lot of guys still hang out with each other because we still kind of live close.\\n\\\"They're still our guys, and we're still going to love them. They're just not currently our teammates.\\\"\\n\\nContact Cade Hampton via email at cbhampton@muncie.gannett.com or on X, formerly known as Twitter, @CadeHamp10 .\\nThis article originally appeared on Muncie Star Press: How MAC football has shifted in the NIL and transfer portal era\\n        Published: Sat, 26 Jul 2025 13:07:51 +0000\\n        Source: The Star Press\\n        \\n---\\n\\n        Type: \\\"RSS Feed\\\"\\n        Headline: ESPN names their biggest question marks, 'what-ifs' for Alabama football in 2025\\n        Description: The quarterback position and Alabama's pass rush were named by ESPN as the Crimson Tide's biggest 'what-ifs' for 2025.\\n        Link: https://rolltidewire.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/crimson-tide/football/2025/07/26/alabama-football-schedule-2025-biggest-what-ifs/85383202007/\\n        Content: ESPN college football analyst Bill Connelly thinks the Alabama Crimson Tide have as good a chance as almost anyone to win the national championship in 2025.\\nConnelly, a leading figure behind ESPN's popular analytics-driven SP+ rankings, recently listed potential title contenders for 2025 with his annual 'what-ifs' for each team . Alabama tied with Penn State for the fewest question marks entering the season with only two.\\nAlabama's 'what-ifs': the quarterback position, led for the moment by junior Ty Simpson, and the defense's ability to get after the quarterback.\\nTo the former, coach Kalen DeBoer and offensive coordinator Ryan Grubb named Simpson the frontrunner as spring practice wrapped up in April following Alabama's annual A-Day event.\\nThe concern for Simpson is obvious, mainly his lack of experience. In parts of three seasons, he's 29-of-50 for 381 yards through the air while rushing for 130 yards and three touchdowns in 15 games. Most of that was in mop-up duty with the exception of Alabama's ugly 17-3 win at South Florida in September 2023.\\nSimpson's next college start will be his first, but Connelly contends that Simpson may not necessarily need to be elite in order to succeed. Think of Jake Coker, who led Alabama to the national championship in 2015.\\nConnelly said:\\n\\\"Honestly, after Jalen Milroe's negative-play troubles in 2024 (11 interceptions, 9 fumbles, 23 sacks), there's a path for Simpson to succeed by simply making sure the team in crimson controls the ball. He'll have strong weapons to whom he can distribute the ball -- Ryan Williams, slot man\u00a0Germie Bernard, Miami transfer\u00a0Isaiah Horton, young former star recruits such as\u00a0Jaylen Mbakwe,\u00a0Jalen Hale\u00a0and\u00a0Cole Adams\u00a0-- and lord knows he has waited for this opportunity. If he can't deliver early, sophomore\u00a0Austin Mack\u00a0or freshman\u00a0Keelon Russell\u00a0(the No. 2 player in the 2025 class) could step in. One way or another, solid quarterbacking could take Bama far.\\\"\\nThe concern for Alabama's pass rush stems from the defense registering just 25 sacks all of last year. Nearly one-third of those came in two games: the Crimson Tide's Week 2 win over South Florida and their 27-25 victory over South Carolina on Oct. 12. Alabama racked up four sacks in each of those games.\\nMoreover, the Tide's sack leaders from a year ago, linebackers Jihaad Campbell and Que Robinson, both departed for the NFL.\\nPer Connelly:\\n\\\"(T)he pass rush really was a liability at times, and the only two players with more than 2.5 sacks last season are gone. Outside linebackers\u00a0Jah-Marien Latham\u00a0and\u00a0Qua Russaw\u00a0look the part but had just one sack each. One way or another, the pressure needs to improve.\\\"\\nApart from Russaw, two players that pressure should come from are inside threats like Tim Keenan III (40 tackles, 2.5 sacks in 2025) and LT Overton (42 tackles, 2.0 sacks).\\nDeBoer was asked at SEC media days earlier this month who stood out as pass rushers heading into the season.\\n\\\"I think guys like\u00a0LT Overton\u00a0jump out with me,\\\" he said. \\\"LT was there a lot last year. Those are the next steps you want to take. Not just he, but a lot of guys finishing the plays. LT has it in him, the seal set. He has those instincts. Continues to hone in on taking it to the next level.\\n\\\"Qua Russaw is another guy,\\\" DeBoer continued. \\\"Some underclassmen are coming up that are doing a nice job, too. Looking forward to the progress they've made physically to be able to put themselves in a chance to let their work happen on the football field on Saturdays.\\\"\\nAlabama will open the season against Florida State at Doak Campbell Stadium in Tallahassee on Aug. 30. Kickoff is scheduled for 2:30 p.m. CT.
